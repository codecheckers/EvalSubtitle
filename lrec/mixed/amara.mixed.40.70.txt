Welcome to the world # of cyberharassment.
xxxx of harassment women <eob> face xx # Pakistan is very <eol> and leads to # <eob> sometimes deadly <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> accessing the internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge.
It's x # form of oppression.
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country in xxx world, with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eol> mobile technologies, and 15 percent penetration. <eol>
And this number # doesn't <eob> seem # # go down <eol> with <eol> xxx rise <eob> of new # technologies. <eol>
Pakistan also the birthplace <eob> of the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eol> Malala # <eol>
But <eob> just xxx of Pakistan. <eob>
Another # aspect is where the twisted xxxxxxx of <eol> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are <eol> to disrespect women <eob> and even them xxxxxxxxx <eob> in the name of so-called "family where # women <eob> are left # die <eol> right # outside their houses for # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx <eob> in # xxx name of "family honor". <eol>
# me say <eob> very clearly: <eol> it's <eob> not honor; <eob> a # murder.
I come from a xxxx # small village xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eob> where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx their higher <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
elders of xx family <eol> didn't allow <eob> # xxxxx women to xxxxxx their higher # education or their professional careers. <eol>
However, xxxxxx # the other <eob> male guardians of my family, <eol> my father was # who really <eol> supported # my # <eob>
To get law xxxxxxx of course, # really difficult, <eob> and [there frowns of disapproval. <eob>
xxx the end, I xxxx it's either # me or xxxxx and chose myself. <eol>
xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx <eob> family's traditions <eob> and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to <eob> a mobile <eol> phone until married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eob> this became <eob> a tool for my own surveillance. <eol>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve <eob> of this <eob> and # threw me of xxx house, <eol> xxxxx my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time when I xxxxx <eob> asked myself,
Why are # women not to enjoy xxx xxxx equal <eol> rights <eol> enshrined # in our # Constitution? <eol>
While # xxx xxxxxx # that a woman <eol> has <eol> xxx same <eob> # xxxxx xxxxxx <eob> the # information, why is it # always men xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eob> who # are xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, <eol> effectively making # the law <eob> irrelevant?"
So I decided to # take a step, <eob> instead keep questioning <eol> # <eob> patriarchal structures and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital # Rights <eob> Foundation # in <eob> # 2012 to address all xxx issues <eob> xxx women's experiences in online spaces <eol> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for xxxx and safe <eob> # internet <eob> convincing <eol> young women <eob> that <eol> access # to the safe internet <eol> is fundamental, basic, # human right, <eob> I'm trying <eob> # to play part xx igniting spark <eob> to address the <eob> questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eob>
With <eob> # xxxx # xx # heart, <eol> xxx # to offer a <eol> solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eob> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December # 2016 -- <eob> <eob>
to support xxx # <eol> xxxxx <eol> who # xx know who to xxxx to <eob> when # they face serious threats online. <eol>

xx a critical moment. <eol>
Our leaders, some # of our great institutions <eob> xxx failing us.
xxxx <eob>

is unacceptable. <eol>
This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs?
How are we going <eol> to xxxxxx the right
xxx going to # be easy. <eob>
For <eol> # years, # I've worked with <eob> talented # teams and they've chosen xxx right objectives <eob> xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to # share with you <eol> what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> xxxxxx what's <eol> how and # <eob> they xxx meaningful # audacious goals, <eob> the xxxxx # goals xxx the right # reasons. <eol>
Let's # go # back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, # is <eol> # me. <eol>
I've <eol> got a <eob> to xxxxxx <eol> I'm x computer <eob> I've got <eob> long hair, <eol> I'm under # xxxx Grove, been called the manager <eob> of his # or any xxxxx <eol> era. <eob>
Andy was a leader <eob> xxx also a # teacher, <eob> and he # # to <eob> me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know.
Execution is xxxx matters the <eob>
And so # x # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off the xxxxxxx doesn't # it? <eol>
And it's all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eob>
So # here's # # classic video from 1970s xx professor Andy <eol> xxxxxx
(Video) # Andy Grove: # The xxx key # phrases xx <eol> the management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they <eob> match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx
The # <eob> key results have to measured, <eol> the end you <eob> can look <eol> and without xxx argument say, <eol> "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. <eob> # Simple. <eob>
Objectives and <eob> Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system <eol> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work xxx teams, they even work for individuals. <eob>
xxx # are <eob> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key are # how <eob> I'm going to get # xxxx # done. <eol>
Objectives. Key <eob>
What and # how. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many xx us are setting # goals wrong, xxx most us <eob> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eob>
lot of <eob> organizations xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them. <eol>
They ship their xxxxxx <eol> they introduce their # products, <eob> they make xxxxx numbers, <eob> but # they lack a sense xx <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # you set <eol> these goals the right <eob>
First, # you must answer <eol> xxx "Why?" <eob> Why? <eol>
Because transformational teams <eol> combine their # ambitions <eob> xx their <eob> # passion and to their purpose, xxx they develop # a clear <eob> and xxxxxxxxxx sense xx <eol> why.
I to you a <eob> story. <eob>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eob>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eol>
She runs a <eol> company called Nuna.
Nuna is a health care company.
And when xxx founded, <eob> they used data # to serve the # health lots xx workers at large <eol>
And two years <eol> into <eol> the life, <eob> the # federal government issued a <eob> to build the first # ever cloud database <eob>
Now, <eob> xxxxxx # remember that is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children <eol> xxx xxxxxx <eob> with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at # the xxxx # xxx # just # xx <eob> xxx database had to be built # xx xxx year, and they xxx <eol> xxxxx set <eob> commitments <eob> they had to honor, <eob> xxx frankly, they weren't # going # xx make <eol> very much money on the <eol>
This # <eol> was a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini # seized <eol> xxx <eob>
jumped # at # opportunity. xxx did not flinch. <eob>
xxxx
Well, xxxx a # xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism.
And # when he <eob> xxx seven, <eol> xx had xxx xxx seizure <eob> at Disneyland.
# xxxx ground. <eol> He <eob>
Jini's are xxxxxx immigrants.
They came to # the xxxxxxx <eob> with <eob> # resources speaking little xxxxxxxx so it up # xx <eob> # <eob> xxxx <eob> to enroll family # in Medicaid.
was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her <eol> mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eol> xxx that xxxxxxx bid on, won <eol> xxx delivered on that <eol> # contract. <eob>
Here's Jini # to tell # you xxxx <eob>
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eob> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eol> today it provides for <eol> and millions of # others.
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid. <eob>
Every # row of is a <eob> life <eob> whose story # deserves <eob> to <eol> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us that compelling why <eol> can the launchpad for our objectives.
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to have accomplished. <eob>
objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, <eob> they are xxx they're a # kind of vaccine <eol> xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You # think a rockstar <eob> be an unlikely xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eob> but <eol> for years, Bono # used xxxx to # xxxx # a global war xxxxxxx poverty and disease, and <eob> xxx organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first is xxxx # relief <eob> for the # poorest countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is universal access <eol> to drugs.
Now, why these good objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back <eol> xx # our # checklist. <eol>
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate? <eol>
How
# xxxxxxx does passion <eol> xxxx xxx # to <eob> do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a <eol> perfect # rhyme with the head, then # passion means
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eol> the <eol> chemistry # contained # inside # xxx <eob>
gives # us # for risk, <eol> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable <eol>
And when xxx have that sort <eol> # structure xxx <eob> environment <eob> and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eob>
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eol> and magic # is right # the corner.
xxxx is perfect.
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows.
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # key results. <eol> That's xxx # we meet # our <eob>
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound. <eol>
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx # realistic.
xxxxxxx <eob> and they're verifiable. <eob>
# <eob> xxx xxxx key # results.
In xxxxx introduced OKRs <eol> to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and <eol> Sergey. <eob>
xxxx they are, # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eol>
he really xxxx was, <eob> "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eol> (Laughter)
And I took xxxx as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down # objectives and xxx key <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've xxxxxxxxx them <eol> for everyone to xxxx <eol>
these xxx xxxx for bonuses # or for promotions.
xxxxxxx # set <eob> # aside. <eob>
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eol> and xxxxxx to # <eol> get commitment to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> xxxxx was to # build <eob> the next client platform <eob> the future of web applications -- <eol> in other xxxxx the <eob> browser. <eol>
# <eol> very thoughtful <eol> how # he chose <eol> his # key # results.
How do you measure <eol> the best browser?
could xx clicks # or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going to decide <eob> Chrome a # great or not. <eob>
So he had this # one <eol> three-year-long # objective: build xxx xxxx <eob> xxxxxxxx
And <eob> then every # year he xxxxx to the xxxx # key # results, <eob> of users, he upped the # ante.
In the first year, <eol> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx and he missed it.
He xxx less than 10. <eol>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar # to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users.
Somewhat
In the xxxxx # year, <eob> he <eol> the ante once # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx # an marketing campaign, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> improved # the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eob>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx
xxx I like story, not so # xxx the # xxxxx ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx <eol> carefully choosing the objective <eol> and <eol> then xxxxxxxx to it year # after xxxx after <eob>
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eob>
Now, I think of # OKRs as vessels <eob> xxxx made from the # xxxxx and xxxx of our # ambitions.
What <eol> really matters xx # the why that we xxxx into those # vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet.
They're not # going to be <eol> for a strong culture <eob> or # for stronger leadership, <eob> # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, <eol> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eol>
I <eob> # to think <eol> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment. <eob>
Do you # # right <eob>
xxxx xxxx xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do it xxxxxx <eol>
If you'd some feedback # them, <eol> you can send # to # me. <eol>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If think xx world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a # Nuna, xx of Google, <eob> they're <eol> # remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable xxxxxx <eol> high-quality for ending global poverty, <eol> access # to <eol> all xxx # information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eob> xx powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been xxxxxx the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eol> xxx I want you <eol> to join # me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because we can # take xxxx <eob> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
We can take them to # families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to <eob> our governments. <eob>
those governments accountable.
We can transform <eol> # those informations.
We can back on the track <eol> if we can and # do measure <eol> what really xxxxxxxx <eol>
# you. <eol>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
What # history? <eol>
It is # something written by <eob> the <eob> winners. <eob>
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eol> should be # focused on xxxxxxx <eol> like <eol> # Lenin # or <eob>
xx a result, people <eol> xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something <eol> xxxx was predetermined or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and common people could not <eob> influence it in xxx way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx <eob> believe <eol> that Russia could been <eob> will a truly # democratic xxxxxxx # this is due <eob> # to the way <eol> history has been framed <eob> xxx # Russia. <eob>
And this is true. <eob>
To prove # it, # <eob> two <eol> of xx life trying <eob> to go # # years # <eob> xxxxx <eol> to xxx year the xxxx of the Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what <eol> if internet and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago?
So last year, xx <eob> x social network xxx dead # <eob> people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My <eol> team and x created # <eob> our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded <eob> all possible # real diaries <eob> and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 xxxxxx 100 ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or can # follow a xxxx feed <eob> for each day 1917 xxx read what people <eob> xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, xxxxx xx # Pavlova and others thought and <eob> felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eob> being xxxxxx like you and me, <eob> xxx demigods, <eob> # we see that history # of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxxxxxx # was a for many Russians, <eol> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could # never have prevailed, <eob> just # because xxxxxxxxx was xxx our destiny.
xxx if we # take <eob> broader <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, # xxxx # led to <eob> of communist dictatorship.
But this project, <eob> we # xxx that Russia <eol> have # had a # different history and a xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as <eob> any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the posts xxxx # <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> xxx the # first # country # in the to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or xxx of the xxxxx # ones <eol> to grant women # voting <eob> rights.
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced # history <eol> can help <eob> a better because history is just a rehearsal <eol> what's happening xxxxx now.
We xx need new telling history, <eob> and xxxxx xxx example, <eol> we started # a new <eol> online # project that is called 1968Digital.com, xxx that <eol> # is # an online <eob> series <eol> that # you an impression <eol> of year, <eol> a # year by social change that, many ways, <eol> the # world as we <eob> xxxx it <eob>
But we # making that history xxxxx <eob> by xxxx <eob> if xxx the main <eol> could <eol> xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and were fighting for the values, <eol> no if they lived <eob> in US or in USSR <eob> or xx France or xx # China <eob> or in Czechoslovakia.
By xxxxxxxx history in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> through # media, <eob> we show that people in # <eol> are not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eob>
gives any user a possibility <eol> xx reclaiming <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an
Ideas matter. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxxxx # scientists, <eol> philosophers <eol> # xxxxxxx <eob>
# xxxxxxxx
We xxx make <eol> history. <eob>

Computer algorithms today <eol> xxx performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx with accuracies, a xxxxxxx <eol> using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

AI # xx <eol> poised to make an incredible impact on xxx lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eob> we still face xxxxxxx challenges <eob> in detecting and <eol> several <eol> life-threatening illnesses, such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eob>
of patients every xxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> due to xxxxx and # oral cancer. <eol>
best # way to # help these patients <eol> is to # perform early # detection <eol> and diagnoses of these # diseases. <eob>
So how do # we <eol> detect today, <eol> and <eob> can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx help? <eob>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eol> are <eob> suspected of these diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first <eob> expensive <eob> medical imaging # technologies <eob> xxxx as imaging, CTs, MRIs, to be <eob> performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images <eob> are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx expert physician then diagnoses <eob> # talks xx # the patient.
As you # xxx see, this is <eol> a <eol> very resource-intensive process, <eol> xxxxxxxxx # <eob> # expert # physicians, <eob> expensive imaging technologies, xxx # is not # considered <eob> practical <eol> the developing xxxxxx <eol>
And in fact, in many industrialized # nations, xx <eob>
So, can we solve # this # <eol> problem <eol> using artificial <eob> intelligence? <eob>
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional artificial <eob> intelligence # architectures to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> repeat, on an order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eob> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After xxxxx I would then # go <eol> an expert <eob> would # then analyze <eol> those images for # <eol> me. <eob>
And # using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> I can # a # standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning <eob> to # provide <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial approaches <eob> suffer from <eol> the same # problem. <eob>
xxxxx # <eol> amounts xx xxxxx # expert # and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx intelligence architectures to solve these important <eol> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly what xx group # at MIT Media xxxxx <eob>
We variety <eol> xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx xx solve xxxx xx the most important <eol> challenges facing us # in medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In <eob> the # example I shared <eol> with # today, we <eol> two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eob> required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms.
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eol> we wanted xx # reduce <eol> of medical imaging <eob> technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients.
So how did we do it?
our first <eol> goal, <eol> xx starting xxxx # tens and thousands <eol> these very expensive medical images, <eob> xxxx traditional <eob> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx
xxxx xxxx image, my team and I <eob> figured out a very <eob> clever # way <eol> to extract # billions xx information packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering # of xxxxxxx on the # medical image.
In a # <eol> we # one image <eob> xxxx # billions xx training data points, <eob> massively <eol> reducing xx data <eob> needed for <eol>
xxx our goal, to # the # use of # expensive medical <eob> imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # <eob> screen xxxxxxxxx we started <eob> with a standard, <eob> white light <eol> acquired either # from a # camera <eol> or x <eob> mobile # phone, xxx the patient.
Then remember those <eol> billions # of information # packets? <eol>
xx overlaid xxxxx from xxxxxxx image onto # this image, something that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much <eob> to xxx surprise, <eol> we xxxx <eob> required -- <eob> I only 50 -- these images # <eol> our algorithms # xxxx # efficiencies. <eol>
To <eob> # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using # very medical # images, <eob> we now train the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using 50 of these <eob> high-resolution, <eol> but standard # <eol> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and # xxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and provide xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, <eol> some <eol> very simple, # white light <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx from the instead # of expensive medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that # xx # <eol> to enter xx # era <eol> where artificial intelligence <eol> is going to make <eol> impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think that thinking <eob> xxxxx traditional <eob> AI, <eob> which is data-rich xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eob> about # unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which can accept xxxxxxx of data <eob> and xxxxx some xx <eob> the most xxxxxxxxx <eol> problems facing # us today, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx in health care. <eob>

What if take x pill or a vaccine <eob> xxxx <eob> just like getting over a # cold, <eol> you # could # heal your wounds faster?

Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eob> xxx body <eob> # grow back <eol> without # <eob> scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even # <eob>

ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # <eob> xxxxx new
when I place <eob> material, <eol> scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system # creates small # environment of cells and proteins <eol> xxxx can <eob> change xxx # way <eob> that # our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eob> our xxxxx # activities, <eob> like going for a run or inside binge-watching <eob> an entire TV <eob> show on Netflix, <eol> the immune <eob> environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that <eol> our # stem cells # xxxx # and # develop.
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eob> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eol> we get xxx cells instead of muscle. <eol>
xxxxx scaffolds are <eob> # made <eol> of a variety of different # <eol> plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, <eob> that are <eob> more or less porous, <eob> gels different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eob> can even xxxx materials <eob> release xxxxxxx time. <eol>
So # in xxxxxx # orchestrate xxxxxxxx show cells xx # giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> # can # be changed # for different tissues, <eob> just # like a producer xxxxx change the set <eob> for # "Les # Mis" versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eob>

the xxxxxxx we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eob> a moldable filler <eob> even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we <eob> aren't # to wake up xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx xx able to <eob> heal Wolverine. <eol>

2015, xxxx caused over <eol> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> xx provide power to # their homes. <eol>
This # xx # when <eol> energy # becomes # x burden. <eob>

xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx <eol> choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to her # flu medicine, <eob> xx do <eob> # you feed her? <eob>
Or do you # keep her
xxxx an choice, <eob> and # month, <eob> seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy. <eob>
This a xxxx # larger <eol> and systemic xxxxxx <eol>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people xx color, <eol> who <eob> spend xxxx xxx <eob> xxxx <eol> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eob> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass <eob> of 37 million xxxxxx # a xxxx <eob> who are xxxxxx to xxxxxx <eob> energy for # <eob> xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those # with <eol> high energy # burdens have # <eob> a greater likelihood # of conditions <eol> like # heart disease and # asthma.
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have the tools to # xxxxxxx <eol> these systemic inequities. <eol>
The <eob> technology is # here. <eol>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology are # decreasing.
even as we <eol> the majority of xxxxx who own <eol> # much more # than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when # I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
# is to alleviate energy <eob> burdens <eol> by <eol> working with communities, <eob> utilities and # xxxxxxxxxx alike <eob> provide to # energy, <eob> energy energy technology. <eob>
But <eob> # there's no one way to solve this. <eol>

So xx by working directly <eob> the communities <eob> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx <eob>
We <eob> host <eol> and events # for communities to # xxxxxx poverty, <eob> and how making even updates to their homes like xxxxxx insulation windows and heaters # go # <eol> x long <eob> way # xx # maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting <eol> to community # solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eob> smart # home research <eob> and # installation xxxxxxxx <eob> to help families bring <eob> # down <eob> their # bills. <eob>
We're xxxx working # directly <eol> with elected # <eob> advocating for <eob> xxxx <eol> equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of # energy and resilience <eob> we have to xxxx together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US # spends <eol> over # three billion a year <eol> energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eol> millions # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they're only able xx help <eob> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy equity <eob> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure <eob> and impartial access <eob> to energy that clean, <eol> reliable and <eol> affordable.
At # scale, microgrid technology, <eob> xxx energy efficiency <eob> dramatically # improve xxxxxx health. <eob>

But # the # question is: <eob> In # order # to # get there, <eob> are xx # willing to # xxxx up?
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eol> that wanted to <eob> # embark a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their <eol> offering to be # intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm xxx sure how many of you <eol> # a # bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate # xxxx traditional banks like. <eol>
You see lots # of people # suits taking elevators xx go <eol> to <eob> department, <eob> sitting with marketers, <eob> xxxxxxxxx with <eob> engineers, # etc. <eob>
You see meetings # 20 # people <eob> nothing gets <eob>
Great xxxxxx They <eol> end up <eol> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eob>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
this # xxxx <eob> xxxx in to transform, <eob> would have xx # improve <eol> time to <eol> market <eol> by changing their ways xx working as well. <eob>
But xxxx <eob>
To # get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx <eol> to xxx have x look companies <eob> that seem # to xx more innovative, <eob> like Google, Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And remember how we xxxx # <eob> the halls at xxx xx these # companies in # December 2014, a <eol> xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and a xxxx <eol> # xx bankers. <eob>
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we <eol> # asked, <eol> xxxx # is # <eob> your company <eob> organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx to # get org <eob> # chart. <eob>
But instead, they <eob> used strange drawings <eob> with funny # names like # <eol> and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx <eob> explain how xxxx were organized. <eob>
So then tried to # <eob> that # our own world.
We # xxxxxx "How many # people <eol> are xxxxxxx for you?" "It depends". <eob>
"Who <eob> you xxxxxx to?" <eob> depends".
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" <eol> xxx depends". <eob>
You <eob> can our surprise.
xx were # <eob> xxxxxx for what we thought <eol> xx the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eol> and <eol> answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, over the # <eob> course # of that day, <eol> we gained <eol> understanding of # <eob>
They believed in xxx power of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eol>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups. <eol>
They xxx product people engineers in the same team <eol> so they could <eob> # design, build <eol> and # test ideas <eob> # with # xxxxxxxxx <eob> independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eob>
xxxx # did not <eob> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They all the skills needed <eol> there in <eol> the team. <eob>
xxxx # at end of that day, <eob> xx had a <eob> to reflect xx what we # had learned. <eob>
And we started to # xxxx # their <eob> so # we already thinking xx how <eol> xx apply some # xx these <eol> # xxxxx a # bank. <eob>
then, one # of the <eob> hosts, <eol> guy # who # had not # said a word # all # <eob> he suddenly xxxxx <eob> xxx x see <eob> you like xxx <eob> model.
But I # have one for # you: <eob> What # are you to give xxxx <eol> we willing # <eob> to give up? <eob>
xxx not # <eol> xxxx # <eob> an answer immediately, <eol> xxx we # knew # <eol> xx was right.
Change <eob> is <eol> only about <eol> xxxxxxxxx the xxxx <eob> it's about giving some of old as well. <eob>
Now, over # the # past <eol> years, <eob> I worked with companies <eob> all <eol> # xxxx # the world to change their <eob> xxxx xx # working. <eol>
And clearly, <eol> every company <eob> has xxx skeptics <eob> about why this is <eol> xxxxx xx for them. <eob>
"Our # <eol> is more complex," <eob> or # have <eob> the xxxxxx <eob> # xx # like we xxxx or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our # industry".
xxx for xxxx <eob> bank and also <eob> for the other companies <eob> xxxx <eob> x # have worked with change was possible.
a year, # we up old silos <eol> between # marketing, product, channels and xxx <eob>
Three # employees # were <eob> into 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams. <eob>
So instead of product people <eob> sitting just with # people engineers engineers, x product # person <eol> and an engineer <eob> xxxx now xxxxxxx of xxx xxxxx <eob>
You could be a xxxxxx of a team <eob> responsible for account opening <eob> or for xxx mobile # banking app, xxxx <eol>
At the go-live date <eob> of xxxx <eob> new organization, <eol> people <eob> were xxxxxxx hands <eob> for # very # xxxxx # time, only to find xxx xxxx been <eob> xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from # each other <eol> but they # were sending each other xxxxxx and <eol> xxxxxx # reports for last 10 years.
You hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, <eob> you're # the guy # that I <eol> xxxxxx chasing for answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee <eob> xxxxxxxx every <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just # <eol> raise # it <eol> to get input from the engineer <eob> xxx # is # sitting right next # <eol> to him. <eob>
They xxxxxx test with customers immediately # -- <eob> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # no xxx tape, just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# getting there is not # easy.
And # it # turns out, <eob> are # you willing <eol> to give up?" <eol> is # exactly # right <eob> # to <eob> xxxx
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary # teams.
xxxxxxx # of going <eob> up xxx # down <eob> the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx want # xxx team to <eol> # decide. <eob>
xx do we need xxx the skills <eob> and for xxxx <eob> in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eol> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eol> different xxxxxxxxx # today? <eol>
xx should we invest <eob> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things across # xxxxxx <eol>
We still need <eob> some xxxx <eol> of management xxxxxxx <eob>
# these changes to structure <eol> and process procedure -- <eob> they xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eol> x found the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eol> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let xx try to illustrate.
If we # these teams <eob> to be <eol> fast, <eol> flexible, <eol> creative, like mini-start-up, <eol> they have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx <eol> commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, # how # xxx <eol>
No micromanagers. <eol>
But # it also # each employee <eol> needs to become leader, <eob> regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title. <eol>
It's # about all of # us <eob> up <eol> to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all # teams xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx because # that would <eol> certainly lead # to chaos. <eob>
# we need and # autonomy <eol> at # same just xxxx a flock # of birds. <eob>
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eol> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and # each new behavior, <eob> there xx <eob> on something as # well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure <eol> xxxx everyone # in xxx organization is aligned around <eol> the overall <eob> purpose the why <eob> and the -- what. <eob>
But # then xxxx xxxx let go <eol> # trust their # teams <eol> to the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eob>
But you know # how say <eol> that information is a source of xxxxxx <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information may feel as # if <eol> they're giving up xxxx power.
xxx <eob> it's # not just managers. <eol>
The <eob> teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently <eol> as <eob> well. <eob>
these # the # <eob> xxxxx <eol> typically work in short # sprints, <eol> and at the end # # sprint, <eol> they organize # a demo session <eob> xx share <eob> # the output of # what they've done, transparently. <eob>
xxxx <eob> each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what <eob> they xxx working xx <eol>
Now, all this transparency <eol> be uncomfortable xxx people, <eol> # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eol> xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do <eol> xx transparent <eob> for everyone. <eol>
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eob> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive # at # another company to explain he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eol> instead of looking at # status reports, <eob> he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # the team floors <eol> attend one of <eol> their sessions.
xxx instead of <eob> # <eol> telling people what xx <eol> looks # <eob> ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change <eol> for # someone # who used # xx be master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eol> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eob>
In <eob> xxxxxxxx many # projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
xxx I have # more # transparency, I can course-correct <eol> much # earlier <eob> if needed".
And managers <eob> need <eob> to # change as well. <eol>
First # of <eob> all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need <eob> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was this idea of thinkers and # <eol>
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx instead xx only <eob> managing <eob> other # people, <eol> middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches. <eol>
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, <eol> you <eol> have just been <eol> other people what to xxx but now xxxxxx expected <eol> to # # # again. <eol>
Clearly, this model <eol> is not for everyone, <eob> and great people <eob> # leave the # company. <eob>
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy.
xxx of this <eob> is hard <eob>
xxx <eob> # it's worth it. <eob>
xxx companies that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx new # features # few times
xxx they have releases every few # # without # xxxxxxxxx <eob> the xxx tape, whole xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> becomes more efficient.
And # if you walk the # halls <eol> xx these today, <eob> you just feel a new energy.
It # feels as if you're # xxxxxxx the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, <eob> # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx <eob> they # cannot xxxxx victory yet.
But at least with this new # model, they are much better prepared to # respond to <eob>
xxxxx is getting <eob> faster and more # xxxxxxxx <eol> so we # <eob> need # to reboot # our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change is not # structure <eob> or process <eob> # <eol> and xxxx also not <eol> senior taking charge. <eob>
Leaders xx all of those <eol> in # the organization <eol> who embrace the change. <eob>
all <eob> have # to lead the # change. <eol>

xxxxxxx are xx # <eob> Airbnbs, <eol> they <eol> # are in new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
xx long as they can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice from the very # beginning. <eob>
Notice x don't xxx <eol> xxx word # "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, xxxx some are essential <eol> and some aren't.
use xxx <eob> word "distributed" <eol> xxxxxxxx <eol> # what we do, <eob> where everyone xx <eol> on # xxxxxxx field. <eol>
I think a # distributed workforce is # most effective xxx <eol> to # company. <eob>
The key is <eob> you have to <eob> # consciously. <eob>
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, <eob> many <eob> of # xxx first # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years.
I # wanted to continue xxxx <eob> for one # reason. <eob>
I believe # that talent and <eob> are equally distributed <eol> the world. <eob> is # <eob> not. <eob>
In <eol> the tech xxxxxxxxx fish <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx the # same # small or xxxx <eol>
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx fish from # the entire ocean.
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # who <eob> # grew <eob> up in xxxxx # but lives in California, # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, wakes up and goes to sleep <eob> wherever <eob> they are xx # world. <eol> They bring a # <eob> understanding # of xxxx <eob> # culture <eob> and # a different lived experience.
At the base of xxx <eob> decision <eob> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # how # xxxx do their work.
Unless you're in a <eob> where xxxxxxxx <eob> # hours are # important, <eob> you can make your # own schedule. <eob>
Everyone have a xxxxxx office, xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you # can choose there's music <eol> xxx when <eob> silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx <eol> the xxxx should be. <eob>
You can save the time spend commuting <eol> and put xx into things <eol> that important xx <eol>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is ideal a # company.
xxx people xxxxx # xxx <eol> me, <eob> "This works for y'all, xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # an # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # do # few xxxxxx <eol> to # build distributed <eol>
First: document everything. <eol>
In xx it's easy to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # <eol> moment, <eob> in the kitchen, # in xxx <eol>
But if # people work remotely <eol> and some members of the team are having conversations they xxxxx xxxx access <eob> they'll these <eob> xxxxxxxxx being made <eol> without understanding the xxxx <eob>
Always leave x trail # of xxxxx you were <eob> and what xxx were thinking about.
This # allows others pick <eol> xx <eol> you # left off. <eob>
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eob> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> it's great to think <eob> as <eob> # an organization <eob> people and xxxxxx <eob>
have as much communication <eob> as possible xxxxxxx <eol>
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows <eob> # people <eob> up
You xxxx <eob> xxxx to find xxx # <eob>
There xxx so xxxx apps and xxxxxxxx <eob> that <eol> help # with day-to-day communication, <eol> xxxxx <eob> conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
The things # that <eob> changed how # you xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx aren't objects # anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx
So xxxxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxxxxxx tools that enable # collaboration, see what works. <eol>
Create productive, face-to-face # time. <eol>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place <eol> xx weeks out <eob> of the year <eol> and you # might three four # xxxxx apart. <eol>
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. a # year xx <eob> # do a grand # <eob> xxxxx xxx entire company comes for a week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is people. <eol> xxxx to make sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on xxxx page, <eob> and xxxx xxxx # a deeper <eol> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # <eol> the rest xx the year, <eol> they can bring together <eol> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy.
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx their # own work environment. <eol>
Every person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx put towards <eol> a co-working # xxxxx <eol> or to buy so # they don't out of xxx coffee shop. <eob>
One # in Seattle <eol> xx pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a # on x xxxxxxx pier.
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eol> gets x home-office stipend. <eob>
xxxx <eob> # is money can invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # right # chair, monitor, <eol> # right xxxx so # they can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eol>
Today, <eob> there are just a # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed <eol> xxxxxx <eol>
In a decade or # xxxx x predict that 90 percent of companies <eob> that are to be # changing the # course of xxx xxxxx <eol> are going <eol> function way. <eol>
They will to be distributed # first, or # they'll # be replaced # <eob> xx xxxxx that <eol> are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx xxxxx <eol> what you're # going xx xxxxx next, <eob> consider xxx # you can <eol> tap <eol> into # global talent, <eol> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work <eob> where they # feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully whatever it # is you're creating together.
