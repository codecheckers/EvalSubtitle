xxxxxxxxxx and xxx # Results, <eol> or # OKRs, are simple goal-setting # system <eol> and they # <eob> work for <eol> # organizations, <eob> they # work for teams, <eol> they even work for <eob>
xxx objectives are # xxxx <eol> you want xx have # accomplished.

I # work with x remarkable #

Jini's # younger brother Kimong <eob> # xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>

xxxxxxx Jini Kim: <eob> Medicaid saved my xxxxxx from <eol> today # it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eol>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid. <eob>
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx story xxxxxxxx <eol> to be # told with dignity. <eol>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eob> that <eob> a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's # <eob> xx xxxx to xxxx # accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx action-oriented, xxxx # are inspiring, <eol> xxx # they're # x of vaccine <eol> against # # thinking. <eol>

The # first xx debt relief <eob> for the xxxxxxx countries the world.

Now, <eob> # why xxx these good objectives? <eol>
Let's xx # back to our checklist. <eob>

<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eol>

What # is history? <eob>

xx # prove it, I spent years <eob> of my life xxxxxx to go xxx # years xxxxx to <eob> # <eob> the xxxx 1917, <eob> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

But this project, # <eob> we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eob> xxx # a # <eol> xx any <eob> other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading # the posts 1917, you learn Russia <eol> was the # first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eob> or # xxx # of xxx first ones <eob> xx xxxxx # women voting # <eob>

Thousands of xxxxxxxx every xxxx lose their lives <eol> due xx # liver <eob> and # cancer.
Our <eob> best way xx # help these patients is # # perform early <eol> and diagnoses xxxxx <eol>
So how do we detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx <eob>
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx # # diseases, <eol> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive xxxxxxx # imaging technologies <eob> as fluorescent imaging, <eob> CTs, # xxxxx to be <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images and talks to # <eol> the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eob> a very resource-intensive <eob> requiring xxxx # expert physicians, xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and <eob> is xxx considered <eob> practical <eol> for xxx developing
And in fact, in # many <eol> industrialized # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx <eob> traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> xx # solve this <eol> # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eob> x repeat, on <eob> xx order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical xx # generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx # then go <eol> # expert physician, would xxxx those images xxx xxx <eol>
And those two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train xxxx neural network <eol> xx x xxxx learning network <eol> to provide xxxxxxxxx <eol> diagnosis.
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eol> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same xxxxxxxx
Large of expert physicians <eol> xxx expert medical imaging #
So, # can we <eob> invent xxxx <eob> scalable, effective and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important problems # facing us <eob> xxxxxx <eob>
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eol>
We <eob> have invented # a <eol> of AI # architectures <eob> to # solve some of the most important us today <eol> in xxxxxxx # <eol> # and clinical trials. <eob>
In xxxxxxx shared <eol> xxxx # you # had two <eob> goals. <eol>
xxx first goal # xx <eol> the # of <eol> to train <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we xxxxxx <eob> of # technologies <eob> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how # <eob> xxx we do it? <eol>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of xxxxxxxx <eol> with tens xxx thousands <eob> xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx # traditional AI, we started # with # single medical image. <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way xx # extract # billions <eol> of information
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eol> on the <eol>
In a sense, # we converted # one <eol> xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, <eol> massively reducing xxx amount of needed # for training.
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> we started with a # standard, xxxxx xxxxx # <eol> xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eob> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- <eob> xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to xxxx efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of 10,000 <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we <eob> # <eob> now # train the AI algorithms <eol> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using only <eob> 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eob> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eol> our algorithms # can accept, <eob> in the and even some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eob> to <eob> # enter era xxxxx # intelligence <eol> is going xx make # incredible <eol> on our xxxxxxx <eob>

Now, # just # when xxx were # a <eob> kid <eol> xxx you'd break your pencil <eob> xxx # tape back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eob> but it might not be <eob> in # most functional way, <eob> xxx we'll a scar. <eob>
# if we xxxxx have these helper T xxxxxx <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, <eol> xxx develops fat cells xxxxxx # of # <eob> xxx if there's <eol> # fat our muscle, <eob> it isn't xx # <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eol> our # xxxx grow <eol> # <eol> xxxxxxx # these scars look # # what # it <eol> we were # even injured.
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create <eob> that # give us the signals # by changing the response.
We xxxx that # <eol> x # xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx in xxxxx xxx xxxxxx system will # to # it. <eob>
This <eob> # <eob> ranges # xxxx # pacemakers to insulin pumps <eol> the xxxxxxxxx that # engineers are using <eob> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xx when I place that # material, <eol> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system <eob> x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eob> that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave. <eob>
Now, # just like # xxx # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily <eol> activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # and # <eol> entire # xx show # on Netflix, <eob> the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eob> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop. <eob>
xx we have the xxxxx signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we fat cells instead of xxxxxxx
These # scaffolds made of a variety different things, <eol> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eol> derived materials, <eol> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges # that xxx # more or less # porous, xxxx # of <eob> different stiffnesses. <eob>
xxx # <eol> can even make the materials <eob> xxxxxxx # different <eob> signals xxxx time. <eob>
So in other # words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx this Broadway of <eol> cells <eob> by <eob> them # xxx <eol> stage, xxxx # <eol> that # xxx be <eol> changed for # different xxxxxxxx <eob> just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set <eob> for # "Les # <eol> "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eol>
xxx xxxxxxxxx specific types of signals that how # our # body responds to <eol> to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eol> xx even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we # aren't xxxxx to up xxx heal xxxx Wolverine. <eol>
xxxxxxxx not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with xxxxx advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx with # our immune xxxxxx <eol> help # tissue xxx heal wounds, <eob> we could <eob> xxxxx seeing <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx market <eob> that # # body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> maybe # xxx xxx xx able <eob> xx # keep # xxxx a xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

xxxxx it's <eob> # # way illustrating <eol> xxxxxxx to xx the most change <eob> that is # # of working today. <eol>
The world <eob> is getting <eol> faster <eol> more complex, so # we need a xxx # way working, way that <eol> alignment around <eob> that takes xxx bureaucracy and that truly xxxxxxxx people xx make # decisions xxxxxxx <eob>
But the # is: In order to get there, <eob> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, # I was working a bank <eob> that to embark <eob> on a transformation. <eob>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx <eob> simpler, <eob> more intuitive, xxxx relevant.
Now, <eob> I'm # <eol> not sure how many of you <eob> have # # from # the # inside, so <eob> let me # try # to # illustrate what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eol>
# of # people xx xxxxx <eob> xxxxxx elevators go <eol> xx # <eob> their department, <eob> # marketers, <eol> engineers xxxx engineers, #
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>

And there are <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting done forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew xxxx <eob> in # <eob> xxxxx to <eob> they would have # to improve <eol> their time to xxxxxx <eob> by drastically changing <eob> working xx <eol>
But how? <eob>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eob> to xx and have <eob> # a look at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, <eob> like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos.
I remember how we were walking <eob> halls at # xxx # of <eob> in 2014, <eob> a # management <eob> and a of bankers. <eob>
We felt # strangers in <eol> # land, <eob> surrounded <eob> by beanbags <eob> xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx smart, # employees. <eol>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected <eob> to xxx an org xxxxxx
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange xxxx # names like <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> and and "tribes" <eol> to # explain # how they xxxx organized. <eol>
So then we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working <eol> xxx you?" "It depends". <eob>
xxxx you report to?" <eob> "It <eob>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that xx gained a # better understanding xx xxxxx model. <eol>
They believed the # <eol> of small, autonomous teams.
xxxxx teams like <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and IT engineers <eob> in the team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers <eol> independently of others the company. <eob>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
had all skills needed <eol> there xx the team. <eob>
Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eol> we # xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxxx on what <eol> xx had learned. <eol>
And # we xxx # started to # like xxxxx model, <eob> so # <eol> we # already # of how <eol> to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # <eob> one of # # hosts, a guy xxx had not # xxxx a <eol> word all # day, <eol> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So <eob> I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eol>
But I have for you: What are you willing to # give xxxx What were we willing xx give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not # only xxxxx <eob> embracing # the new; <eob> xxxx <eob> xxxxx <eob> giving <eob> xx on some the old as xxxxx <eob>
Now, xxxx xxx # xxxx # five <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx <eob> to change their ways <eol> # of # xxxxxxxx <eob>

"Our product is # more complex," <eol> xx <eol> # "They xxxxx # have <eol> the legacy IT like # xx # xxxx <eob> # just won't # allow this <eob> in our industry".
xxx xxx bank <eob> and also <eob> xxx xxx other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, <eol> was possible. <eob>
Within a # year, we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> product, channels xxx IT. <eob>
xxxxx thousand employees xxxx <eob> reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of # <eol> sitting with # people <eob> and # engineers engineers, <eob> a product xxxxxx xxx an engineer <eol> were now <eob> members of the same # xxxxx <eob>
You could be a member of # <eob> a xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx or xxx <eol> xxx mobile # banking app, etc.
At xxx # date <eol> of that organization, <eob> people # xxxx # shaking # hands <eol> for the # # xxxxx time, <eob> only <eob> to xxxx out xxxx they xxx sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other <eob> but # # were each # other emails <eob> and # status reports for the <eol> last 10 # <eob>

# xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eob> together every <eob>
If product <eob> an # idea, <eol> xx can raise xx <eob> get <eol> # xxxxx from the # engineer <eol> who # is sitting right next to xxxx <eob>
They can xxxxxx to # <eol> with customers immediately # <eol> no handovers, xx # PowerPoints, # no red <eob> just # <eob> getting xxxxx done.
Now, getting there # is # xxx easy. <eob>
xxx turns # out, "What xxx you # willing to # give xxxx <eob> is exactly # xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eol> decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eol>
Instead xx # decisions going <eol> up and <eol> xxxx the organization, <eob> want <eob> the team to # decide. <eob>
But # to <eob> do so, we need all # the # skills <eol> and # expertise for # that decision <eol> in # team. <eol>
xxx <eob> this # brings difficult <eob>

Or # should we <eol> in # better xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # do we consistency in # way xx do <eob> across these teams?
xx # <eob> need xxxx kind <eol> matrix. <eol>
Now, # all changes to <eob> structure <eol> and process and # procedure -- <eob> they are # <eob>
But # xxx <eob> I # xxxxx that xxx xxxx <eol> difficult # xxxxx # to change <eob> xx our xxx behavior.
Let me xxx xx # illustrate. <eob>
If we # want these <eob> # teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eob>
# this means xx # cannot leaders commanding their people what # to xxx <eol> when # xx do, how to xxx <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
# it xxxx <eol> means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eob> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eol>
It's about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eob> xx take <eob>
obviously, xx also <eol> xx have all # these teams <eob> # in different directions, xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we <eob> need <eob> alignment and autonomy <eob> at the # xxxx <eol> xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eob>
an xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> setting, <eob> xxxx requires # behaviors, <eob> xxx <eob> xxxx each new xxxxxxxxx there xx giving up on something <eob> xxx as well.
Leaders have # make <eob> sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the <eol> is aligned <eol> xxxxxxx <eob> # # -- the xxx <eob> -- the xxxxxxxxxx # the what.
But <eob> then # they have to xxx # xx <eol> and trust their xx # make xxxxx decisions <eol> on xxx xx # get # there. <eob>

xxx you know how # <eob> information x <eol> xxxxxx of # power? <eob>
Well, # some managers, <eob> may feel xx if they're <eol> giving up xxxx source xx power. <eol>
# xxxx not xxxx # managers. <eob>
The teams need # xx communicate <eol> openly and # as # well. <eob>
xx <eob> # these xxxxxxxxxx <eob> the <eol> xxxxxxxxx in # short sprints, <eob> and # at # <eol> xxx # xxx <eob> # sprint, <eol> organize a demo # xxxxxxx <eob> to share the output <eol> of what # done, <eob>

Now, all <eol> # transparency uncomfortable xxx people, <eol> because suddenly, # there is <eol> place to hide anymore. <eol>

First # all, without xxx handovers xxx # the <eob> xxxx of x need for managers.
And in <eol> the # old xxxxx # was <eob> # # of <eob> thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees # would just xxxxxx # orders. <eob>
But xxxx <eol> instead of <eol> other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eol> to # player-coaches. <eob>
xx imagine, for the last xx # years, <eob> have # just <eob> been # telling other people # to do, <eob> now <eob> you're expected xx do things <eob> xxxxxxxx again. <eol>

# <eob> # is new # <eob> less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this xx # work. <eob>
But <eol> # <eol> worth it. <eob>
The companies that I # with, <eob> they were used # xxxxxxxxx <eob> new product features # a few per # year.
they # have # releases every # few # weeks, and without the <eol> # handovers <eol> and the # xxx # tape, <eob> the # whole organization <eol> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol>

I don't use <eob> xxx # word xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx it up expectation, that # people # xxx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where <eob> # everyone is <eob> on an equal playing field. <eol>
I think # a workforce <eob> is the # most effective xxx to build x # company. <eol>
The key xx # you have to <eol> approach it # <eob>
When # xx started WordPress, <eob> many <eob> # of # the first <eol> 20 <eob> xxxxx <eob> were I'd never # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to # continue # that <eob> xxx simple reason.
I believe that # talent and intelligence <eol> are equally distributed <eob> # world. But opportunity # <eob> not. <eol>
In Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eob> the small # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company can # fish <eol> from the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone who grew # xx <eol> in Japan but <eob> lives in <eob> you # can gain # someone who lives, works, <eob> # <eol> up goes # sleep <eol> xxxxxxxx # they # are # the world. <eob> They xxxxx # a different <eol> understanding that culture <eol> and a # lived # <eob>
At xxx xxxx xx xxx decision <eol> to go # distributed, <eob> a desire # give people <eob> autonomy <eol> xxxx # <eol> # they xx xxxxx work. <eob>
you're a # <eol> where specific hours are <eob> you <eob> can make # your xxx schedule. <eob>
Everyone xxx have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx <eob> windows, the food they want # eat, xxx # choose xxxx # music <eol> and # # # silence.
You can # xxxxxx what temperature the room xxxxxx # be. <eob>
You can save the xxxx <eol> you'd # spend # commuting <eob> and put it xxxx # things <eob> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company.
But often ask me, <eob> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, <eol> about # everyone xxxxxx <eol> If you xxxx an office, xxx can do # # things <eob> to distributed capability.
First: xxxxxxxx everything.
In xx office, it's easy to <eob> xxxx decisions in the moment, the kitchen, in the <eob>
if people <eob> work remotely and some members of the <eol> are xxxxx <eol> they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made <eol> understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave # of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about. <eol>
This # allows others # # pick up <eol> where left off. <eob>
allows people in different <eol> time zones to xxxxxxxxx also great to # think about <eol> as an organization people xxxxxxx and people joining. <eol>
Try <eol> # have <eol> # as much # communication possible xxxxxxx
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows <eob> new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eol>
You need to xxxx the right tools. <eob>
are many <eob> xxxx and services <eol> that with # day-to-day <eol> communication, <eob> video <eob> # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things <eob> that # <eob> changed xxx you xxxx <eol> probably aren't # xxxxxxx # anymore. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your # <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> xxxxx collaboration, <eob> see # what works. <eob>
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eol> you're in <eob> the # <eob> same place <eol> 48 # weeks # out of <eob> # the year and # might <eol> # or <eob> # four apart. <eol>
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. <eob> Once a year xx xxxxx # meet-up <eob> xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx <eol> for week. <eob>
It's <eob> half-work, half-play. <eob>
xxx goal is # people. <eol> # <eob> want to sure <eol> everyone's aligned <eob> and # xx xxxx xxxxx and # have a # deeper connection <eol> with their colleagues.
When work # together rest of the year, <eol> they <eob> together that # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people flexibility <eol> to make their xxx work environment. <eol>
Every person # <eol> a co-working # <eob> xxxx they can put xxxxxxx # a <eob> or # xxxx to buy coffee, so # xxxxx <eol> get kicked # out xx # <eol> xxx # coffee # <eob>
One in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends <eob> together <eob> and rented a # xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing xxxxx <eol>
Each person who # # the company gets a <eob>
This is money they # <eob> can invest in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, <eob> xxx # desk so # xxxx have <eol> the most productive environment xxx them. <eob>
xxxxxx there # just a <eol> # few companies <eol> that <eob> are xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx that percent of companies <eol> are # # changing <eol> xxx course of the world <eol> are going <eob> # to # this # way. <eob>
They will # <eob> evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eob> they'll be replaced by those xxxx
As you # xxxxx about <eol> xxxxx to xxxxx next, <eol> consider how xxx can tap <eob> into # global talent, <eob> xxxx # people autonomy to live <eol> where they feel they <eob> # should <eob> participate <eol> # fully in whatever <eol> it is # xxxx you're <eob> creating <eob>
