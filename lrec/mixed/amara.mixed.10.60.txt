Imagine waking up # to a stranger -- sometimes <eob> # multiple strangers -- <eol> questioning your right to <eob> existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eob> and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to <eob> xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
kind of harassment that women <eol> face in Pakistan is serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eol>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> from accessing the internet <eol> -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is # the sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eol> with 140 million people having access <eol> to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet <eob> penetration. <eol>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eob> with the # rise xx new technologies.
Pakistan is also the birthplace <eol> of <eob> the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eol> the <eol> twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; <eob> where men xxx allowed to # disrespect <eob> women <eob> and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where # women are xxxx <eob> to die <eol> right xxxxxxx <eob> their houses <eob> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in the <eob> name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very # clearly: it's not honor; <eob> it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder.
I <eob> come from a very xxxxx village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, where women are # allowed <eol> to pursue <eol> their xxxxxx education. <eob>
The elders of <eol> my xxxxxxxx family <eob> didn't <eol> allow their women <eob> to pursue their # education <eol> xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike other male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get xx law degree, of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there # were] frowns of disapproval. <eob>
But xx end, I knew it's either me or # them, and I chose myself.
(Applause) <eob>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow <eob> me to own a mobile <eob> phone until I was married. <eob>
And even when I xxx married, <eob> this tool xxxxxx x tool for my # own surveillance. <eob>
When # I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of and threw me out of <eob> house, <eob> with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eol>
And that was the # time when I first asked # myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same <eob> equal xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution? <eol>
While the states that # a woman has same equal access <eob> to the information, <eob> why # xx it always men -- <eob> brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> xxx # are granting these rights to us, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So <eob> I decided to take a step, instead <eol> of keep questioning these patriarchal <eol> and societal norms. <eob>
And founded the Digital <eob> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues <eol> and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eol>
From lobbying free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women <eob> that access to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, right, I'm trying to play <eob> my part in igniting the spark <eol> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a hope <eob> xx my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first <eob> cyberharassment help line <eol> in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the women <eol> who do not know who <eob> to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online. <eob>
I think of <eob> the xxxxx who do not have <eob> the <eob> necessary support <eol> to <eob> deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their # daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access # to the internet <eob> is access to knowledge, and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I # fight for women's digital rights, I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical <eob> moment. <eob>
leaders, <eol> some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eol>

In some cases, it's because <eol> they're bad or unethical, <eob> but often, xxxxxxx us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has xx stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we <eob> going <eol> to # choose the right course?
It's not xxxxx to be easy. <eol>
For years, I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams <eob> they've # chosen the right objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eol>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today # I'm going to share with you what really a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eol> how and <eob> they set meaningful and audacious <eob> xxxxxx <eob> the # right <eob> goals # for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me.
I've got a lot to <eob> learn, a computer engineer, <eol> I've got long hair, <eol> but I'm working under <eob> Andy Grove, <eol> who's been <eob> called the greatest manager <eol> of his or xxx other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said <eob> to me, "John, <eob> it almost doesn't <eob> matter what you xxxxx <eol>
Execution xx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and <eob> # Key Results". <eob>
kind xx rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove.
Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management xx # systems <eol> xxx the objectives and xxx key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the <eob> direction.
The <eob> key results have to be measured, but at the xxx you can look <eob> and without any argument say, "Did <eol> I <eob> # do that, or <eob> did I <eol> do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or xxxxx are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for organizations, <eob> xxxx work for teams, <eob> they even work xxx individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eob> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eol>
What and how. <eob>
But here's <eob> the truth: <eob> many of us are setting <eob> goals wrong, <eob> and most of us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations set objectives and # meet them.
They ship their sales, <eob> they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their numbers, <eol> but xxxx lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the <eol> right way? <eob>
First, you <eob> must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions <eob> to their passion <eob> and to their purpose, and they develop a # clear and compelling <eol> of why.
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
work with a remarkable entrepreneur.
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a called xxxxx <eob>
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when was # founded, they used data to serve the health needs <eol> of xxxx of xxxxxxx at <eol> large companies.
And <eol> then two years <eob> into the company's # life, <eol> the <eob> xxxxxxx government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eol>
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that <eob> that <eol> serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eol> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> this <eob> database had to xx built <eob> in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> xxxx they had to honor, <eob> and they weren't # going to make <eol> very money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not <eol>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger <eol> brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
xx fell to the <eob> ground. <eob> He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean <eob> immigrants. <eol>
They came to the country <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking <eob> little xxxxxxxx so it was up to Jini to xxxxxx family in <eob> Medicaid.
She # was nine years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and # that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on # that contract. <eol>
Here's <eob> Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: <eol> saved # my from bankruptcy, <eob> xxx today <eob> it # provides xxx health <eol> and for <eol> millions <eob> of others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with # dignity. <eob>
JD: # <eol> And Jini's # story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eob> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a # kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eol>
You think a rockstar <eob> would be an unlikely user <eob> of Objectives and Key Results, but for years, has used OKRs <eol> to # wage a global war against poverty and disease, <eol> and xxx ONE <eob> has focused on <eob> two really gorgeous, audacious objectives.
The first is debt relief <eob> for the <eob> poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives? <eol>
Let's go back to our checklist.
Significant? # Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes.
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just listen # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eol>
How passionate? <eol>
What actions does your passion <eob> xxxx you to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
The OKR <eob> framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained # inside it. <eob>
It gives xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> failing is not a # fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eol> magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right # around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats # of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, <eol> the hows are the key results. That's how we meet our objectives. <eol>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're xxxxxxxxxx but realistic. <eob>
They're <eob> measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those # are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey. <eol>
# they are, 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eol>
not quite.
What # he really said was, "We # have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a <eob> go". <eob> (Laughter)
And I took that xx a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every since then, every Googler has written # <eol> down her objectives her key results.
They've graded them, <eol> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are <eob> not used <eol> for bonuses or # for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eol>
They're for a higher purpose, <eol> and that's get collective commitment <eob> to # truly stretch goals. <eob>
In xxxxx a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was <eol> to <eob> build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> the future web -- <eol> in other words, build the browser. <eol>
He was thoughtful <eol> about how he <eob> chose his key results. <eob>
How xx you measure the xxxx # browser?
It could # be # ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide <eob> Chrome is a great browser or not. <eol>
he had this one <eob> objective: <eob> build # the best browser.
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the <eob> same key results, numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eob> his goal # was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eol>
He got less than 10. <eol>
Second # year, he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eol>
He # got to # 37 # million users.
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third <eol> # year, he upped the <eob> # ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eol>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, improved the technology, kaboom! <eob>
He <eol> got 111
Here's why I # like this story, <eob> not so much for # the happy ending, <eob> but it # shows someone carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a # perfect story <eob> for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eob> as transparent vessels that # are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why <eol> that pour <eob> into those vessels. <eob>
That's why we xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet.
They're not # going <eol> to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are in place, <eob> they can take you <eob> to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eob> about your life for # a moment. <eol>
Do you have the right metrics? <eol>
Take time to write down your values, <eol> your objectives and your # key results. <eol>
Do it today.
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eol> you can send # to # me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we <eol> think of the world-changing goals <eob> of Intel, <eol> of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eob> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable health care, high-quality for everyone, ending global poverty, <eob> access <eol> # to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've xxxx called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eob> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's xxxxx # for # what it is <eol> that really matters, <eob> because we can take xxxx beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them # to our families, <eob> to our schools, even to our # governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable.
We # can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can get back on right track <eob> if xx can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eol>
Thank # you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
What is <eol> history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eol>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eol> Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eob> in many countries, like mine, Russia, xxxx # at # history # as something that was predetermined <eol> or determined by the <eob> leaders, <eob> and xxxxxx people could not <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians xxxxx # do not believe <eob> that # Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever will be # x truly democratic nation, <eol> and this is due to the way <eol> history has been <eob> framed to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true.
To prove it, I spent two years <eob> of <eol> my # life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to year 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution. <eol>
I asked # myself, <eol> what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last # year, we built a social network for dead people, <eol> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created software, <eol> digitized and uploaded <eol> all real diaries and letters written by # more than 3,000 people 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow a news feed for each day of 1917 <eob> and read <eob> what people <eol> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova and others thought and felt. <eol>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like # you and me, <eol> not demigods, <eob> and # we see that history consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius ideas". <eol>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eob> used to that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas <eob> xx freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, just because <eol> was not our destiny.
But if we take a broader # look, <eob> it's not that black # and white. <eol>
Yes, 1917 led to # <eol> 70 years <eol> of communist # dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we xxx that Russia <eol> could have had a different history <eob> xxx a democratic future, as any other country <eob> could or still can. <eol>
Reading the posts from 1917, you learn that <eol> Russia <eol> was the <eob> first country in world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, or one of first ones <eol> to grant women rights. <eol>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary # people influenced history <eob> can help us create # better future, <eol> because history is just # <eob> a rehearsal of what's happening right <eob> now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eol> and this year, for example, <eob> xx started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary series <eol> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eol> a year marked by global social # change <eob> that, in many ways, <eob> created the world as we know it now.
But <eob> we are making xxxx history alive by xx all the main <eol> xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a # lot individuals <eol> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same values, <eol> matter if <eob> they lived <eob> in the US or in USSR <eob> or <eol> in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing <eob> history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people power are not the only ones making choices. <eol>
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, <eob> scientists, philosophers # matter. <eob>
We shape society.
We all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
Computer algorithms today are performing incredible tasks <eol> with high accuracies, at # a massive scale, <eol> using human-like # intelligence. <eob>
And <eol> intelligence of computers <eol> is # often referred xx as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eol>
AI is poised to an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, we still face massive challenges <eol> in detecting diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as # infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands patients every year <eob> lose xxxxx lives due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our # way to these patients <eob> is # to perform early <eol> xxxxxxxxx and <eob> diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect # these diseases today, <eol> xxx # artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients # who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected <eob> of # these diseases, <eob> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eol>
Once those images are collected, another expert <eob> physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the xxxxxxxx <eob>
As xxx <eob> can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive xxxxxxxx requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is not considered practical <eol> for the developing world. <eob>
And # <eol> fact, many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can we solve <eob> this problem <eob> using intelligence? <eob>
Today, if I were to use traditional <eol> artificial # intelligence <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I xxxxx require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on <eol> an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, x would xxxx go <eob> to an expert physician, who would then analyze those images for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, <eob> I xxx train a standard deep neural <eob> network or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx # first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert physicians <eob> and expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we # more scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial intelligence architectures <eol> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing # us today?
And this is exactly <eol> what <eob> my group at xxx Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety of unorthodox AI architectures <eol> to some of the most important <eob> challenges <eol> facing us today in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In the <eob> example I shared with you today, had two goals. <eob>
Our first <eob> goal was to reduce <eob> the number of images required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal <eob> -- we were more ambitious, we wanted # to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging <eol> to screen patients.
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eol> instead of starting <eob> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive <eob> images, <eob> like traditional AI, <eol> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eol> figured out a clever way <eol> to extract billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These information packets <eob> included xxxxxxx <eob> pixels, geometry <eol> xxx rendering of the disease <eol> on <eob> the medical image.
In a sense, we converted one image <eol> xxxx billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for training. <eob>
For our second <eol> goal, <eob> to reduce the <eob> use of expensive <eob> imaging technologies to <eol> screen # patients, <eob> we started with # <eol> a standard, <eol> xxxxx light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient.
Then remember those <eob> xxxxxxxx of <eol> information packets?
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, <eob> creating something <eob> that we call x composite <eol> image. <eob>
Much <eob> to our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images to xxxxx <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies.
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of # using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical <eol> we # can now train the AI algorithms <eol> in an unorthodox way, using only 50 # of these high-resolution, but standard photographs, <eob> acquired <eob> from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the and even right now, <eob> xxxx # very simple, white light <eol> photographs from the <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging <eob> technologies. <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we are <eol> to enter an era <eol> where artificial intelligence is going to make an incredible <eol> impact xx our future.
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, <eol> xx should thinking <eol> about unorthodox artificial intelligence architectures, <eol> which can accept small amounts <eol> of data <eob> and solve some of the most <eob> important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just getting over # a cold, you heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, if we xxxx <eol> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eob> and painful side effects of our inability <eob> to regenerate <eob> or <eob> regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to materials that instruct our <eob> immune system to give us the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to # fight disease, <eob> we # could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eol> to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, <eob> but there are xxxxxxx organisms <eob> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and <eol> even # us mere <eob> humans <eol> can regrow our # liver <eob> after xxxxxx more than half of its original mass.
To <eob> make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the xxxxxx system. <eol>
From a scrape <eob> on your knee <eob> to that annoying sinus infection, <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what <eol> I <eol> know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that <eob> are currently being # <eob> tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating an injured # muscle with these <eob> materials, <eob> there # was a large number of immune cells <eob> in that xxxxxxxx <eob> the surrounding <eol> muscle.
So in this <eol> case, <eob> of # <eob> the immune cells rushing <eol> off towards to fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eob> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T xxxxx <eol> was # present <eob> inside <eol> that <eob> material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like <eol> xxxx <eob> you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eob> and try and tape it back together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but # it might not be <eob> in # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have these helper # T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx <eob> xx it, <eob> and xx there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our <eob> immune <eob> system, <eob> our body could <eol> grow back <eol> without these # scars and <eob> look like # what xx was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to xxxxxx materials <eol> that give us # <eob> the <eob> signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that xxx time <eol> a <eob> material is implanted in our body, <eol> the # immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers <eob> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers are using <eol> to <eol> try <eob> and build new
So when I # place that material, or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system <eol> creates <eob> x small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the way <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, like the weather affects # our daily activities, <eob> like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> xx entire TV xxxx on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eob> xxx stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of # muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eol> from plastics to naturally <eob> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eol> sponges that more or less porous, gels # of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials release different xxxxxxx over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can <eob> orchestrate <eob> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving <eol> # them the correct <eob> stage, <eob> cues and props <eob> that # can be changed for different tissues, <eob> just like a <eol> producer would change <eob> the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of xxxxxxx that mimic how our body responds to xxxxxx <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, a moldable muscle filler or <eob> even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, we aren't going to up tomorrow <eol> and xx able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system <eol> to help <eol> build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eob> products on the <eol> market <eol> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be xxxx <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you.
<eob>
So, xx a child, <eob> I xxxx # to spend all of my time at <eob> my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I <eob> would dash across the <eob> floor <eob> and stick my face in front xx <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, though brief, was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door # neighbors having to # set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eol> after their heat was shut off, just to keep <eob> their family comfortable for one more xxxx <eol>
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible <eob> choices.
In the average American spends three percent of # their income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, # low-income <eob> and rural populations <eob> can spend xxx <eob> even 30 percent <eol> of their income energy.
In 2015, this caused over 25 million people to <eob> skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy becomes a # burden. <eol>
xxx energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eob> to get xxx flu medicine, <eob> or # do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep <eol> her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible <eob> choice, <eob> and # every month, seven million people choose between medicine and energy. <eol>
This exposes a much larger <eob> and xxxxxxxx issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens are disproportionately people # of color, <eob> who spend more per foot <eob> than # their white counterparts. <eol>
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers who fall into the mass of 37 million people a year <eol> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs. <eol>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eol> have a greater xxxxxxxxxx of xxxxxxxxxx <eol> like heart and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we have the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities.
The technology is xxxxx <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eob> are xxx decreasing.
However, even as we # cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than # xxx average American. <eob>
xxxx is why, when <eob> I was 22, <eob> I <eol> founded the # nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike <eol> xx provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eol>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eol> of xxxxx communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships.
So we start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eob> to learn about energy poverty, and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation for windows and water heaters <eob> can go long way <eol> to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to # community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eob> smart home research <eol> and installation programs <eob> to help families bring down their energy bills. <eob>
even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eob> advocating xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eol> because see this vision of energy equity <eob> and resilience succeed, <eob> have to <eob> work together sustainably.
US spends <eol> over three <eol> xxxxxxx # a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do <eob> help <eob> millions of <eob> people, <eob> but they're only able to help <eol> a fraction those in <eob> need. <eob>
In fact, <eol> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eob> home-energy affordability gap, xx assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into # our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy <eol> # that is clean, <eob> reliable <eob> and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health.
And for those with high xxxxxx burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim <eob> 20 percent of their income -- 20 percent of <eob> a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make # ends meet. <eol>
xxxx # is life-changing.
This <eob> is an opportunity for # to # use their energy savings <eob> sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eob> and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eob> on our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about them. <eob>
There millions nationwide having <eol> to # make the same <eob> impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
Have you ever watched <eob> a flock of # birds work together? <eob>
Thousands <eob> of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable that # these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have <eol> to follow one leader.
Their reaction speed would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds aligned <eol> on a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eol> to autonomous decisions while still flying <eol> in perfect xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Their alignment # enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eol>
Now, what does this have to do <eol> with any one of us?
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eob> I believe to be the most important xxxxxx <eob> that is needed in ways of working today.
The world is getting <eob> xxx more # complex, <eol> so we need a new way of working, a way that creates <eob> around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eol> and that truly empowers people to make decisions # faster. <eob>
But <eob> the question is: <eol> In order to get there, what are we willing to give up?
A few years ago, I was xxxxxxx with a bank <eol> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They wanted their offering to be <eob> more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how <eob> many of you <eob> have seen a bank from the <eob> so me try to # illustrate <eol> what many traditional <eob> xxxxx look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to # go <eol> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers engineers, <eol> etc. <eob>
You see meetings with 20 people where # nothing decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots.
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
Getting anything # can take forever.
So this bank <eol> knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eol> their time to <eol> market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how?
To <eol> get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to go and have a look at companies <eob> xxxx seem to # be more innovative, <eob> xxxx # Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how <eol> we were walking the halls at one these companies in December xxxxx <eol> a management consultant <eol> and team of # bankers. <eob>
We felt like xxxxxxxxx in a land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies and lots of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eob> "How your company <eol> organized?" And we expected to xxx an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they <eol> used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to how they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to <eob> our own world. <eob>
We <eol> asked, "How many xxxxxx <eol> are working for you?" "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
You can imagine our surprise.
xx were for what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> their was, "It depends". <eol>
Now, the course of that day, <eol> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.
They had <eob> product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of <eol> others in the company. <eol>
did not <eob> need handovers <eob> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed right there in the team.
Now, at the end of that <eol> we <eob> had a <eob> session <eob> to reflect on what we had learned. <eol>
And we <eol> had <eob> started xx like their model, <eol> so we were already thinking of how <eol> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But <eol> then, one of the hosts, a guy who had not said x xxxx all day, <eol> he suddenly said, "So I you like <eob> # our model. <eol>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are willing to give up?" What <eob> were we # willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> we knew he was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> xx some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, over xxx past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change <eob> their ways of working. <eol>
xxx clearly, every company <eol> has their own skeptics <eob> about why is not <eol> going to work for them. <eob>
xxxx # product is more <eob> or "They don't have xxx <eob> legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry".
But for this # bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, change # was possible.
Within <eob> a year, xx <eob> completely <eob> xxxx up the old silos between marketing, <eol> product, channels and # IT.
Three # thousand employees were xxxxxxxxxxx into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
xx instead of product people <eol> sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a product person and # an engineer <eol> xxxx now members of the same team. <eol>
You could be member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the <eob> mobile banking app, etc.
At the go-live date of that new <eob> organization, <eob> some were shaking hands for the very first time, <eob> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were <eob> sending each other emails <eob> and status <eob> reports for the last 10 years. <eol>
You would # hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so <eob> you're the guy that I <eob> was always chasing answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eob> together every <eol> # day.
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get from xxx engineer who sitting right next to him. <eol>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just xxxxxxx stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting there xx not easy. <eob>
as it xxxxx out, "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eob> up and down the organization, <eob> want the xxxx to <eob>
But to do so, we need all the skills <eob> expertise for that decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in <eol> different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different # countries today? <eol>
Or should we # <eol> invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eol>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in <eol> the way we do things <eol> across these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eol> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes xx structure <eol> and and # -- they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eol> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own xxxxxxxxx
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these <eol> teams to <eol> be xxxxx <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> xxxx have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this <eob> means we <eol> cannot have leaders <eol> xxxxxxxxxx their people what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eol>
But xx xxxx xxxxx that each <eol> employee <eob> needs to xxxxxx a leader, regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's about of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, # also cannot # to have all these xxxxx <eol> running in different directions, because <eol> that would <eol> certainly lead chaos.
xx # we need alignment and # autonomy <eol> at the same <eol> time, just <eob> like flock <eol> of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, and with # <eob> each new behavior, <eob> there is up <eob> on something <eob> old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to <eob> make sure <eol> that everyone the organization <eol> is aligned around the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what.
But then they have to let go <eol> and # trust their teams <eob> to xxxx xxx right decisions on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But you know how say <eob> that is a <eol> source of <eob> power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're <eol> giving up that source of power. <eol>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in sprints, <eob> and <eob> at the end of <eol> every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eol> to share output <eol> of what they've done, <eob> transparently. <eob>
And <eob> every day, <eob> each # member of the team gives an update of what they are <eol> working on individually.
Now, all this <eob> transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, <eob> because suddenly, there is <eob> no <eol> place to hide anymore. <eol>
Everything do <eol> is <eob> for everyone. <eob>
xxx alignment <eob> is not <eob> easy, <eob> and providing autonomy <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at <eol> xxxxxxx company <eol> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, today, to know how things are going, instead of looking at <eol> status reports, <eol> he needs to walk down xx the team floors to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And instead of telling people what do, <eob> he looks for ways # to help them.
That <eol> is radical change <eol> for xxxxxxx who used to <eob> be <eob> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have # much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct much earlier <eol> if needed". <eol>
And middle managers <eol> need <eob> to change as # well.
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need for xxxxxx managers.
And in the old world, there was <eol> xxxx idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just xxxxxx orders. <eob>
But now, instead <eob> of only <eol> managing other people, middle managers were <eob> xx become player-coaches.
So imagine, the last years, <eob> you have just been telling <eol> other <eob> people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do <eob> things yourself again. <eol>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great people # leave the <eol> company.
the result is a new culture <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all xx this is hard work. <eol>
But # <eol> it's worth it. <eol>
The <eob> companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per <eob>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eob> and # xxxxxxx the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, <eol> if you walk the halls <eol> of <eob> these <eol> companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if # walking <eol> the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up.
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory <eob>
But at least with this xxx # model, <eob> they are # much xxxxxx prepared <eol> to respond # to change. <eol>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change is xxx xx structure <eob> or or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eol> senior executives <eob> taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be <eob> all of those <eob> in the # organization <eol> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eol>
So the question is: What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you.

[The Way We Work] <eob> My name is # Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at # a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's another side to <eob> me: Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I xxxxxxx on Instagram.
As I thought my double life, <eob> I couldn't help but xxxxxx ... <eob>
When your xxxx self <eol> is a little nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to xxx <eob>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eol> I thought there # one way to be x leader: decisive and serious.
But not me.
So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try <eob> to hold in <eob> my hand motions. <eob>
someone who <eob> gets <eob> really excited about things, <eob> so I'd temper that. <eob>
x had this little voice <eol> in my # head, telling me, <eol> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had xxx well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eol>
Cut to: me <eob> in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I up as my favorite TV <eob> show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eob> thinking friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went <eob> viral, <eol> and at first # it was <eob> pure # fun. <eob>
I started these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about <eob> happy it made them, <eol> how it <eol> encouraged them to be their authentic <eol> selves.
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell that little voice in my head to just xxxx up <eob> and let xxxxxx be me. <eol>
But then things got a little <eob> too big. <eob>
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eob> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eol> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I thought was # going to have to get a different job. <eob>
But something happened, <eol> something small. <eob>
I <eol> got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, <eol> "Wow, xxxxxxx <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eol>
And it let me put that little, scared voice away <eob> and just # be excited about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked out.
That's the power of <eob> one xxxxxxx <eob> sometimes all it takes <eob> one ally to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became more <eob> open, <eol> more playful with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eol> them <eob> permission <eol> to be more of themselves as # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eol> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my <eob> team.
But xxxx done <eob> the <eob> opposite. <eob>
Two years in, <eob> I never imagined that this <eol> part of me # not just be embraced, <eol> but could actually help my career.
Now, I'm lucky.
I work in New York <eol> City, <eol> in an office xxxxx creativity valued and I xxx already pretty established <eol> in my when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't. <eob>
all of this <eob> has taught me so much <eob> about just importance <eol> of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to work. <eol>
And it's really challenged <eob> my own misperceptions <eol> about what <eob> it takes be xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
There's no one kind of # way to be a leader.
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eob> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was <eob> hard, <eol> I'd put on my <eol> perfect # mask. <eol>
Now, I can say, <eol> "Gosh, that xxx frustrating".
We can talk about challenges <eol> and struggles in an way, <eol> than everybody pretending <eol> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think <eol> of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different. <eol>
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, is that in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who <eob> say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces xxx all of our strange inner voices have a long way # to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big xxxxxxxxxx <eol> between adapting and disguising.
And I think I learned that a little late.
Personally, I'm taking # all this <eol> as a call # to be the # ally <eob> who, like my # boss did for me, <eob> lets # people know that it's xx to open up. <eob>
If you're <eol> gay, or proud <eob> of your ethnic background, have x disability <eol> or are deeply religious, <eob> see what it's like <eob> being your full self # at work. <eob>
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eob>
The basic problem <eob> with xxxxxxx in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a xxxx base, nomads. <eob>
Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eol> they are new places every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they can find <eob> good Wi-Fi, <eob> don't care xxxxx they are. <eol>
Our focus on distributed didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eob> the very beginning. <eob>
I don't use <eol> the word "remote," <eol> because it sets up expectation, that some people are essential <eol> and # some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, where everyone is <eol> on an # equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed <eol> workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to build a company. <eol>
The # key is # you have to <eol> approach # it consciously.
When we started WordPress, <eob> many of the first 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eol>
wanted to continue <eob> that <eol> for one simple reason. <eob>
I believe that <eol> talent intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eob> throughout # the world. <eob> But opportunity is not.
In Valley, <eob> the big # tech companies fish xxxx essentially the same small pond or bay. <eol>
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can <eol> gain someone who lives, works, <eol> wakes xx and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in <eob> the world. <eob> They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision to go <eob> there's a desire to give # people autonomy <eob> over how they do their work. <eol>
Unless xxxxxx in a role <eol> where # <eob> specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they want to eat, <eol> you can # choose when there's music <eol> and when there's <eol>
You xxx choose <eob> what temperature <eol> the room <eol> should be. <eob>
You <eob> # can save the time you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into <eob> that are important to <eol> you. <eol>
A distributed workforce <eol> is # ideal for a technology company. <eob>
people often ask me, <eob> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what <eob> about everyone <eob> else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eob> you <eol> can do a few things to build distributed xxxxxxxxxxx
First: document everything. <eob>
In an office, <eol> it's easy to make decisions in the moment, in the kitchen, in the hall. <eol>
if people work <eob> and some members <eol> of <eob> the team are having those conversations they don't <eob> have access to, they'll see these decisions being made without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave x trail of you were <eol> and what you were thinking # about. <eol>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eol>
It allows people in different time zones to <eol> it's also great to <eob> think about as an organization evolves, people leaving and people joining. <eob>
Try # to # have as much communication <eol> as xxxxxxxx online. <eob>
everything's shared and <eob> public, <eol> it allows new to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools. <eol>
There are <eob> so many apps and services <eol> that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # that changed how probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eob> through your computer.
So experiment with different <eol> tools that <eol> enable <eol> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eol>
In a office, <eob> you're in the same place 48 weeks out of the year <eob> and you might have <eol> three four weeks apart. <eol>
We xxx to # that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once <eob> a # year we do a grand meet-up where the entire company <eob> comes together for a week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal # <eob> is connecting people. <eob> We want to make <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eob> and <eob> they have a deeper connection with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work together <eob> the rest of the year, <eob> they # can bring together that understanding and empathy.
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can put <eol> towards a co-working xxxxx <eob> or just to # buy coffee, so don't <eol> get xxxxxx out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eol> decided to <eob> pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the company gets a home-office stipend.
This is money they can xxxxxx <eol> in getting the <eob> right monitor, <eol> the right desk <eob> setup, so they can have <eob> the most productive environment for xxxxx <eob>
Today, there are xxxx a few companies that are distributed first.
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict that 90 percent <eob> companies <eob> that are to be changing <eob> the course <eol> of the world <eob> going xx function this # way. <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eol>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eob> how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eol> xxxx people autonomy to live and work <eol> where # they feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully in whatever is that you're creating together.
