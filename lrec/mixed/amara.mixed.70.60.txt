For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx tens # xxx of these # xxxx expensive images, like # AI, <eob> we # started # <eol> xxxx # a xxxxxx # medical image. <eob>

this bank <eol> that in xxxxx # transform, <eob> they # <eob> would have to improve xxxx to # market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> xxxx xx xxxxxxx well. <eob>
But <eob>
xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx go and have # a # at # companies <eol> xxxx # to be # more innovative, <eob> like Netflix, xxxxxxx <eob>

then asked, <eob> "How xx your xxxxxxx And we expected an org xxxxxx
But xxxxxxxx xxxx used strange # drawings <eob> with funny like # <eol> and # and <eol> xx explain how # they # were <eob>
So xx tried to translate <eob> to xxx own xxxxxx

I use <eol> # the # word describe # we do, <eob> xxxxxxxx is <eol> on # playing
I think # a <eob> # xxxxxxxxxxx # workforce xxx most # way # x company. <eob>
xxx key is # you # have # to <eol> xxxxxxxx xx # consciously. <eob>
When # started WordPress, many # xxx first 20 <eol> # people I'd never met xxxxxxx <eol>

In Valley, the big xxxx <eob> from essentially <eol> xxx same small # bay. <eob>
A # distributed company can fish # from # the entire xxxxxx <eob>

You xxx save the <eob> # <eob> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and # put # it into things <eol> xxxx # xxx # # xx xxxx
# <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> is ideal # for # a company. <eob>
But often ask xxxxx works great # for xxxxxx but xxxx about # else?" <eob> xxx # have <eol> an # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # xxx x # few # things <eol> to build capability. <eob>
