Imagine waking up to # a stranger xx <eob> sometimes multiple strangers # -- <eob> questioning your right to <eob> for something that # you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an # <eob> scared # and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of # harassment that women <eol> xxxx in # xxxxxxxx <eob> is very # serious <eol> and leads sometimes xxxxxx outcomes. <eob>
This kind # of xxxxxxxxxx women <eol> accessing # xxx internet # -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of # oppression. <eol>
Pakistan xx the sixth most populous <eol> xxxxxxx in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access <eol> to mobile technologies, <eob> and <eob> 15 # percent penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't to go xxxx <eol> with the # rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also xxx birthplace <eol> # xxx # youngest # Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala #
# that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect is where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is # linked xx # women # their bodies; <eob> where men are allowed to disrespect # women <eob> and # even # kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called # "family honor"; <eob> where women are xxxx to die <eol> right outside their # houses <eol> for speaking to # x man # on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me xxx this very clearly: <eob> it's # not # honor; <eol> it's cold-blooded <eob>
I come from a # very small village <eol> in Punjab, # Pakistan, <eob> where <eol> are not # allowed <eol> pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders # of my extended <eol> didn't allow their women <eob> to pursue xxxxxx education <eol> or professional careers. <eol>
However, unlike the # other <eol> male guardians of # my family, <eob> my father one xxx really <eol> my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] xxxxxx of disapproval. <eob>
But # in the end, I knew <eol> it's xxxxxx me or them, <eob> and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> # allow # me xx own a mobile <eol> phone until x was married. <eob>
And # xxxx when x # married, <eob> tool became a <eol> for my # surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted idea of being surveilled my <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eob> xxx threw out of xxx house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And was the time <eol> xxxx I first xxxxx myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to # enjoy # the xxxxx rights <eob> enshrined in our Constitution? <eob>
While the law that a woman <eol> has the same equal access <eob> xx the information, <eob> why is # always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers # and husbands xx <eob> # xxx granting these rights # to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the # law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I to take a # step, <eob> instead of xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> these patriarchal <eob> and societal <eob>
I founded the xxxxxxx Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to address all the # issues <eol> and women's # in online spaces <eol> and # cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx lobbying # free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young <eob> # women <eob> that xxxxxx to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> xx address xxx questions <eol> that <eob> xxxx bothered me xxx these years. <eob>
With a hope in xx <eob> and to offer a solution to menace, <eob> I started <eob> Pakistan's xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 xx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx extend my # support # to xxx women <eol> xxx not xxxx who # xx turn to <eob> face xxxxxxx # threats # online. <eob>
I think # xx the xxx do # xxx have <eol> the necessary support <eol> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> xxxx feel unsafe in online xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they xx about xxxxx activities, <eob> thinking # that there is <eol> x rape # threat their in-box. <eob>
access to the internet <eol> an # access to <eob> xxx # xxxxxxxxx xx freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm # for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

We're at <eol> a xxxxxxxx # moment. <eob>
xxxxxxxx <eob> xx our # xxxxx institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
Why? <eob>
In some # cases, because they're <eob> or <eob> but often, <eol> they've taken <eob> to the objectives. <eob>
And this is # <eob>
This has to # <eob>
How are we going to # correct these wrongs? <eob>
How # we <eol> xx choose xxx right course? <eob>
xxxx not xxxxx to easy. <eob>
xxx # I've with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen # the right objectives <eol> and # the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> xxxxxx of them failed. <eob>
And xxxxx I'm # to share with <eob> what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's <eol> xxxxxx crucial, <eob> how and why <eob> they # set meaningful and xxxxxx <eob> the <eob> xxxxx xxxxx the <eob>
Let's go # back # xxxxx <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've a lot to learn, <eol> xxx a <eol> computer # engineer, <eob> I've # got long hair, <eob> but I'm # working under Andy xxxxxx who's been xxxxxx the greatest manager <eol> of # his or # any other <eob>
Andy a superb # leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eob> he said to # xxx # "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what xxx know. <eob>
is # what matters <eol> # the most". <eob>
And # xx # invented a system <eol> called "Objectives # <eol> and # <eob>
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxxx xxxxx excellent execution.
So x xxxxxxx video from the 1970s <eob> of <eob> professor Andy Grove. <eob>
(Video) Andy Grove: # The two key phrases of the xxxxxxxxxx by <eol> objective systems <eob> xxx the objectives the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective xx xxx <eob>
The key results have xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> but at <eol> # xxx end you xxx look <eob> xxx without # any argument say, <eob> "Did # I that, or did I # do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or # OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx they work for teams, <eob> they # even work for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eob> you # to have # accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
and <eob> how. <eob>
But here's <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eob> most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A # lot of organizations set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their <eob> but they lack a xxxxx of xxxxxxx <eol> to inspire teams.
So <eob> how do you set <eol> xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, # you must xxxxxx <eol> the question, "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because <eob> combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their passion and to purpose, <eob> and # develop a # clear <eol> and compelling sense of <eob>
I want tell # a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable <eob>
Her name xx xxxx Kim. <eob>
She runs a <eob> company xxxxxx Nuna. <eob>
# is health xxxx data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was # founded, <eob> they used data to serve health needs <eol> of lots of workers at large companies. <eob>
And # xxxx two # years <eol> into the company's xxxxx <eob> the xxxxxxx issued a <eob> build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll xxxxxxxx <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people # with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time # was just 15 # people <eob> and database <eol> had to xx # built in one # year, <eob> and they a whole set of <eol> that they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, weren't going to make <eol> very much money on # project. <eol>
This xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx moment, <eob> and <eol> Jini # seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. She not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal <eob>
xxxxxx younger brother Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when # he was seven, <eob> xx # had # his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to xxx ground. <eol> He <eol> stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are immigrants. <eob>
They # came to the <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was xxxx years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> and xxxx company bid on, # <eol> and delivered on # that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini <eol> # Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved xx <eob> xxxxxx from # bankruptcy, <eob> and today it xxxxxxxx # for Kimong's health <eol> and # millions of others. <eob>
Nuna # xx xx xxxx # letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eol> whose story deserves be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story xx <eob> that # a xxxxxxxxxx sense of why <eol> xxx # be for our <eob>
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished. <eol>
And xxxxxxxxxx are significant, <eob> they're <eob> action-oriented, <eob> are xxxxxxxxxx and they're a kind of vaccine against xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You xxxxx a <eob> be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key <eob> but # for years, Bono # has used OKRs <eol> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty # and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has on two really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for xxx # poorest countries in the world.
The <eol> next is xxxxxxxxx access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eol>
Now, # why are these # good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back xxx <eob>
Significant? <eob> Check. xxxxxxxxx # Yes. <eob>
Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eol>
xxxxxxx xxxxx So you're passionate? <eob>
How # passionate? <eob>
What actions <eob> does your # passion <eol> lead xxx <eob>
If the # heart doesn't xxxx <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then # xxxx passion means <eob> nothing. <eob>
OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry xxxxxxxxx inside # it. <eob>
It gives us # an environment for risk, <eob> <eob> where xxxxxxx is not a offense. <eob>
And when that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right xxxxxxx <eob> magic is around # the xxxxxxx
JD: I love that. <eob>
xxxx the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
with Jini covered the Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eob>
turn our attention xx the hows. <eob>
the the xxx results. <eob> we meet our # objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> specific <eob>
They're aggressive realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx # measurable, <eol> they're <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to xxxxxxxx <eob> cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they xxxx <eol> 24 xxxxx old in their garage. <eol>
And xxxxxx enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt # them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
xxxx # he really # said was, <eob> "We don't # have # any other xxx <eol> to this xxxxxxxx <eol> so we'll # it a go". (Laughter) <eob>
And # x took xxxx # as a kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every quarter since # then, <eob> every Googler has xxxxxxx <eol> her objectives <eob> and key results. <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've published <eob> everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not <eol> for bonuses or for promotions.
They're set xxxxxx <eob>
They're used x higher purpose, <eob> xxx to xxx # collective # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> to truly # stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a # Googler, xxxxxx Pichai, <eol> took # on xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> which was to <eol> the # next generation xxxxxx platform <eob> for # the # future xx web applications -- # words, build the best browser. <eob>
xx was # thoughtful <eol> how # he chose key results. <eob>
How measure the best browser? <eob>
It be ad # xx engagement. <eob>
xxx He said: numbers users, because users are # going decide <eob> if Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had one <eob> three-year-long objective: <eob> xxxxx the xxxx # browser. <eob>
And then every <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of <eob> users, but he upped xxx ante. <eob>
xx # the first year, <eol> his was 20 million users <eol> he xxxxxx it. <eob>
He # less 10. <eob>
Second year, he # raised <eol> the bar to million.
xx got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In # the third year, <eob> he <eol> upped xxx ante xxxx more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 xxxxxxx users. <eob>
why # <eob> I like this story, <eob> so much for the # ending, <eob> it xxxxx # <eob> choosing the right objective <eob> and then xxxxxxxx to <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a xxxxxxx story for a # xxxx like me. <eob>
Now, I think xx OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> hows of # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why <eol> that we # <eol> pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's why we # do our work. <eob>
are # a bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eol> a # substitute for a # strong culture <eob> or for stronger # leadership, <eob> but # when those fundamentals are in place, <eol> xxxx # can take xxx to mountaintop.
I xxxx xx think <eob> about life # a moment. <eob>
Do you right xxxxxxxx <eob>
Take time to # write down xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> your objectives and your results. <eob>
it <eob>
you'd like some feedback # on # them, <eol> you them to <eol> me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>

What is # history? <eob>
It is something # written by the winners. <eob>
xxxxx is # stereotype that # history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, like Lenin or <eob>
As a # result, people <eol> many like # Russia, <eob> xxxx at history as something <eol> that # was predetermined <eob> xx determined # by the xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could # not <eol> in any # way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever be a democratic nation, <eob> and this is to the way <eol> has been framed <eob> to the xxxxxxxx of Russia. <eob>
And this xx not true.
xx prove it, I spent two years <eol> my xxxx trying to go 100 years back, <eob> # the year # <eol> the of the Revolution. <eob>
I # asked # myself, if the <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx # 100 years ago? <eob>
So # last year, we xxxxx <eol> a network for <eob> dead <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and x created our # software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> xxx possible real diaries and letters <eob> xxxxxxx # <eob> more people <eob> years ago. <eob>
So any xx our website xx application <eob> can follow # a news feed <eol> for each day of # xxxx xxxx what people <eol> like Stravinsky or <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx thought # and xxxxx <eob>
We watch all those xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> # ordinary people like you and # me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see xxxx history consists <eol> of their mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, <eol> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a xxxxx for xxxx Russians, <eob> who used to xxxxx that our country <eol> has always # been an autocratic empire <eob> and xxx ideas of freedom democracy could # never have # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> just # democracy xxx not our # destiny. <eob>
But if take x broader look, <eob> it's not that xxxxx and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 # led to # 70 xxxxx <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this xxxxxxxx we # # that Russia <eol> could xxx a different history <eol> and a democratic future, <eol> xx any xxxxx country could # still can. <eob>
Reading # the xxxxx from xxxxx <eob> you xxxxx that xxxxxx <eol> was xxx first country # xx the # xxxxx <eob> abolish # the death # xxxxxxxx <eob> or one of first ones <eol> to grant # women voting xxxxxxx <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history can us create a better # future, <eob> because just a xxxxxxxxx <eol> of # what's happening right xxxx <eob>
We do <eob> need new # ways of # telling <eob> and year, example, <eob> we a new project <eol> that is # called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and is series <eob> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, # 1968, <eol> year marked xx global social xxxxxx <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the xxxxx as we know now. <eob>
xxx we # are making that history # alive <eob> by imagining xxxx if all main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we # see <eol> that a lot of individuals <eob> were facing # the same challenges and # were fighting for the same # values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> # or in <eob> or in France or xx China <eol> or Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we # show that people in power <eol> not the only xxxx xxxxxx # choices. <eob>
xxxx # gives xxx user possibility <eol> reclaiming history.
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an xxxxxxx

Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers <eob>
xx # shape society.
We all # make history. <eob>

Computer algorithms # today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eol> with high accuracies, at a xxxxxxx scale, <eol> using human-like <eob>
And this intelligence xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> is often to as AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
AI is # poised <eob> to make an <eob> incredible impact <eol> on our lives # xx the future. <eob>
Today, <eol> we still <eob> face massive challenges in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several illnesses, xxxx as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands xx patients every year <eob> lose their lives due to liver and oral <eob>
best way to help these patients <eob> is to perform xxxxx detection <eol> and # of these diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, <eob> can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients <eob> who, unfortunately, are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert # physician xxxxx orders <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies <eol> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # to # be performed. <eob>
those images are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> another xxxxxxxxx xxxx # diagnoses <eol> # images to the patient. <eob>
As you can xxxx # xxxx is <eol> a very # resource-intensive process, <eob> expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical # technologies, <eob> and # is not considered practical <eol> for the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in xxxxx in xxxx <eob> industrialized # nations, as well. <eob>
So, we # solve this problem <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # were <eol> # to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures to this <eob> problem, <eob> I would require # 10,000 -- <eob> I # repeat, on an order of xxxxxx <eol> of very expensive medical xxxxxx <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx I would then # go <eol> to physician, <eob> who then # analyze <eol> those xxxxxx xxx me. <eob>
And using <eob> those two pieces of information, <eol> I # can train a standard # deep neural xxxxxxx <eob> or a xxxx learning network <eob> to xxxxxxx # patient's # <eob>
Similar # # xxx approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence # approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and expert medical technologies. <eob>
So, can xx invent # more effective <eob> and xxxx # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve xxxxx very <eol> problems facing xx today? <eob>
And is exactly <eol> what group xx MIT xxxxx does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox architectures <eob> to solve some xx the # xxxx important <eol> challenges facing us today <eol> xx # medical imaging and # clinical xxxxxxx <eol>
In the example I <eol> with <eol> xxx today, we had two goals.
Our first was xx reduce <eob> the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence # algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # reduce the # <eob> use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how did # we it? <eob>
# our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead starting <eol> with tens # and thousands <eob> of very # expensive # medical <eol> like # traditional AI, <eob> started with a single medical image. <eob>
this image, my team and I <eol> xxxxxxx out a very # clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information packets.
These packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and # rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eob>
xx a sense, we xxxxxxxxx one # image <eol> into # of data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount # # data <eol> needed xxxxxxxxx <eob>
For our second goal, xx reduce the use of expensive # medical <eol> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> xx # with # x standard, <eol> # photograph, <eob> acquired either <eob> from x DSLR <eol> camera <eol> x mobile xxx # the # patient. <eob>
Then remember xxxxx <eol> billions information # packets? <eob>
overlaid xxxxx xxxx <eol> the medical xxxxx onto <eob> this image, <eob> creating xxxxxxxxx that we a # composite xxxxxx <eob>
Much to our # surprise, <eol> we xxxx required # -- <eob> I repeat, 50 <eob> of composite xxxxxx to train <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eob> we can now the AI # <eol> an unorthodox way, <eob> using only of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile xxxxxxx <eob> and <eob> diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms accept, <eol> in the future xxxx right # now, <eob> some very simple, # xxxxx <eol> photographs from # the patient, <eol> # of xxxxxxxxx <eol> imaging technologies. <eob>
I xxxxxxx # that we are poised <eol> to enter an era <eol> xxxxx artificial intelligence <eob> is going to # make an <eol> impact on our future. <eob>
And I think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which is application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue thinking <eob> unorthodox artificial intelligence <eob> which # can accept small amounts of data <eol> xxx # some the most <eol> problems xxxxxx us today, <eob> especially # in health care. <eob>
xxxxx you very <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
What # if # you could take # a or vaccine <eob> and, <eol> just like # getting # <eob> over a xxxxx <eob> you could # heal your wounds # faster? <eob>
Today, if we have <eol> an operation or xx accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for # weeks, <eob> and often left with scars and # side effects <eob> of our inability xx regenerate <eol> or regrow # healthy, uninjured <eob>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune to give <eob> the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to xxxxx disease, <eob> could instead instruct <eol> xxx immune system to build # tissues <eol> and more quickly xxxx # wounds. <eob>
Now, body xxxxx out # of xxxxxxx <eol> might seem like <eob> magic, <eob> but there are # several organisms <eol> that can # achieve this <eob>
Some xxx # regrow their <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can # completely regenerate their # arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of its # original mass. <eob>
To make this magic <eol> a # bit closer to reality, <eol> I'm xxx xxx body <eol> can heal wounds and xxxxx tissue <eob> instructions <eol> from the xxxxxxx <eob>
From # a xxxxxx on xxxx knee <eol> that sinus <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our body from xxxxxxx <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> # by using I know <eol> about xxx xxxxxx defense system, <eob> I # to identify key xxxxxxx <eob> our fight # xx build # back <eol> our cuts # and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that treating <eol> an injured muscle with # materials, <eob> there was a number of immune cells <eob> in # that <eob> material <eol> and the surrounding # muscle. <eob>
So this case, <eob> xxxxxxx of the xxxxxx cells # rushing off <eob> towards # infection xx # xxxxxxxxx <eob> they're rushing toward xxxxxxx <eob>
I discovered a # specific type of # cell, <eob> helper <eob> T # cell, <eob> xxx present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for <eob> wound # healing. <eob>
Now, just # like when you were a kid <eol> you'd break pencil <eob> and try and tape it together again, <eob> can xxxxx but it not be <eol> in the most # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> and we'll get x scar. <eob>
So # xx we # don't these helper cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of xxx <eob> and # if fat in our muscle, xx isn't as strong. <eob>
using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow # xxxx <eol> without these scars <eob> xxx look like what it <eol> before we were even injured.
I'm to create materials <eob> that give us the signals to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune <eob> response. <eob>
We know xxxx any <eol> # time <eol> x material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it.
This # ranges from pacemakers <eol> insulin # pumps to materials that engineers using <eol> to and build new tissue. <eob>
So when I place # that <eol> or scaffold, in xxx body, <eob> the xxxxxx system creates <eol> a small environment # xx cells and # xxxxxxxx <eob> that # can change the way <eol> that our stem xxxxx behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> affects xxx activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # xxx binge-watching <eol> an # entire TV show on <eob> # xxxxxx of a <eob> affects the <eol> our stem cells grow # and # develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong # signals, <eob> say the xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> xx get fat cells instead # of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are xxxx <eol> xx a variety # of different things, <eob> from plastics to <eol> derived materials, <eob> of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more or less porous, <eol> gels of different stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even # xxx materials <eol> different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we # xxx orchestrate <eol> Broadway # show # of cells <eob> by giving them # the correct <eol> cues # and props <eob> that # can be xxxxxxx # for xxxxxxxxx # tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> xxxxxxx # Shop # of Horrors". <eob>
I'm # combining specific types of signals <eob> xxxx mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help xx regenerate. <eob>
In <eob> # the xx could xxx <eol> a scar-proof xxxxxxxxx <eob> x moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, we aren't going to wake up <eol> and to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next Tuesday, # either. <eob>
But # with these advances, <eob> and working # with # our immune system <eol> to help build # tissue and # xxxx # wounds, <eob> we # could begin seeing <eol> products on # the market <eob> that work with our xxxxxx defense system <eol> to help xx <eob> xx able <eol> to xxxx pace with <eob>
you. <eob>

So, # <eol> as a child, <eob> I used to spend of <eol> my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash xxxxxx <eob> xxx floor <eob> xxx stick my face in front of <eol> her only # air <eob>
But didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> xxxxxx brief, <eob> was privileged # in our community. <eob>
Growing up, of xxxxxxxxx neighbors <eol> having # to # xxx fake energy accounts or having to steal energy <eob> seemed # normal to me. <eob>
xxxxxx winter, struggling <eob> to get warm, xx neighbors # have # no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their was shut off, <eob> just to keep their # family <eol> comfortable for xxx more day. <eob>
kinds of dangerous <eol> can root <eob> when people are # faced <eol> with xxxxxxxxxx choices. <eob>
In the US, xxxxxxx American spends <eol> three of xxxxx income energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, even xx percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this <eol> million # skip # meals <eob> # provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is # xxxx energy # a burden. <eob>
But energy are so much # more <eol> than just a #
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child to her flu medicine, <eob> do you feed her? <eob>
Or do xxx keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible xxxxxxx <eob> xxx nearly every month, <eob> seven million # people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This xxxxxxx x # much # xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxxxx <eob>
Families # high energy burdens <eol> disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more per square foot <eol> than # their counterparts. <eol>
But also xxxxxxx <eol> and even xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> who xxxx into the mass <eol> xx 37 # million people a year <eob> who xxx <eob> xxxxxx to afford <eol> for basic needs. <eol>
As a those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood # # conditions <eol> like heart disease # asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our xxxxxxx to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have # the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology <eob> is here. <eob>
Cost of # insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are # all decreasing. <eob>
However, even xx xx # approach cost parity, <eob> the majority xx those own solar <eol> earn much more than the average # American. <eob>
xxxx is why, xxxx I was 22, I founded the nonprofit # RETI. <eob>
Our xxxxxxx to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> utilities xxx agencies alike <eob> provide equitable access <eol> to # clean <eob> energy, <eob> energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eol>
But xxxxxxx no one <eob> way to solve this. <eob>
believe in the power <eol> of local xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> xx relationships. <eob>
we xxxxxxx directly <eob> with the xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host # workshops <eol> and events for <eob> to learn # about energy # poverty, and how making # even # small <eol> updates to their # homes <eob> like insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can xx a long # way # to maximize # efficiency. <eob>
We're # connecting neighborhoods <eob> to community solar <eob> and spearheading xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> home research <eob> and # xxxxxxxx <eob> xx help xxxxxxxx bring down <eol> their energy # bills. <eob>
We're # even <eol> with officials, <eob> advocating # for # equitable pricing, because <eob> to see this vision <eol> of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, # the US spends <eol> over three # billion a year <eob> energy xxxx assistance. <eol>
And these programs xx help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but xxxxxxx xxxx to help <eol> a fraction of xxxxx need. <eob>
fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx affordability gap, <eol> so # xxxxx is not sustainable.
by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair <eob> and impartial # access <eob> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and # affordable. <eob>
At scale, xxxxxxxxx technology, <eol> clean xxxxxxxxxx and energy efficiency <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
And # for xxxx xxxx energy # burdens, <eob> it can help them xxxxxxx <eol> 20 percent their income # xx <eob> 20 percent of # person's # income <eol> who's to make ends meet. <eob>
This is <eol> life-changing. <eob>
This is an # opportunity <eol> for xxxxxxxx to <eol> # use their energy # xxxxxxx <eob> to # sponsor their xxxxxxx
I think xxxx to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eol> impossible choices <eol> that they had # to make <eob> xxx <eob> xxx effect # it had <eol> xx our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about xxxxx <eob>
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible today. <eol>
xxx I # know <eob> high # burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to overcome, <eob> but through # <eol> with communities and technology, <eol> we xxxx paths xx xxxxxxxx them. <eob>
And when we do, we will all be # more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
<eob>
Have you xxxx watched <eol> a of birds work # together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> in perfect # synchrony: <eob> xxxxx it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable is that birds <eol> would xxx be able xx do # <eol> if they all xxxxx # have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed <eol> would simply be too # low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these birds are aligned <eob> a few # rules, <eob> allowing every # bird <eol> to # make autonomous # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxx still flying in perfect synchrony. <eol>
alignment enables their <eob> and # their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, # what does <eol> this have to do <eol> with one of xxx <eob>
Well, it's # one xxx of xxxxxxxxxxxx what <eol> I xxxxxxx # to the most important xxxxxx <eob> is # needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The <eol> xx getting faster <eol> and more <eob> so xx need x new <eol> xxx of working, <eob> way that creates <eol> xxxxxxxxx around xxxxxxxx <eob> that <eol> takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly # empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the xxxxxxxx is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing # xx give <eob>
A few # years ago, <eob> # I # was # working with a <eob> that to embark <eol> # a digital transformation.
They wanted their offering to be # simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more # relevant. <eob>
sure how many you <eol> xxxx seen # a # bank from the <eob> so let me try # to illustrate <eol> what traditional banks look xxxxx <eob>
xxx see # lots of people # in suits <eob> taking elevators xx go <eob> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting xxxx # marketers, <eob> engineers with # engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with # 20 people <eob> nothing # gets # decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
there are endless handovers <eol> departments. <eol>
Getting anything done can take forever. <eob>
So xxxx bank knew <eol> that # in xxxxx to transform, <eob> they would to # improve <eol> their time # to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their # working xx well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
get some we decided <eob> to # go and have a look xxxxxxxxx <eob> that xxxx to be innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.
And I remember how xx were walking <eol> the halls at one # these # <eob> December 2014, <eol> a xxxxxxxxxx consultant <eol> and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt # like # strangers # in a strange land, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx by beanbags and hoodies <eob> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we xxxxxx <eol> xxxx is your # organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an xxx # chart. <eob>
But xxxxxxxx they xxxx strange # drawings <eob> with funny xxxxx # like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and # xxxxxxxx <eob> to explain how # they # were organized. <eob>
So then xx # to # translate <eol> that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, xxxx many people <eol> are for you?" <eob> "It <eob>
"Who do you to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on # your priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eol>
We were asking for xxxx we thought <eol> were # of basic principles <eob> <eob> and their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, the course of that <eob> we gained better <eob> # their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eol>
Their teams were like <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in xxx same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently xx others in the company. <eob>
# not need handovers between departments. <eob>
They had all the needed <eol> xxxxx there in the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of # that <eol> had a session <eob> to reflect # on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started to like # their model, <eob> so we were thinking of how <eol> to apply some # <eob> of these ideas # to x <eol>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> guy who xxx xxx said a <eob> word all day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see you our model. <eob>
But I have one question # xxx you: <eob> What are you willing to give up?" <eob> What were we willing to give xxx <eob>
did # not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we knew # he xxx right. <eob>
Change # <eol> is not # only about <eol> embracing <eob> the new; about giving up on some of the old well. <eob>
Now, over # the past five years, <eob> have xxxxxx with companies <eol> xxx over the world <eob> to xxxxxx their # ways of working. <eob>
And xxxxxxxx # xxxxx company <eol> has their skeptics <eol> about why this is xxx <eob> going # work for # them. <eol>
"Our product is more complex," or # "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like <eol> we do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't # xxxx <eol> in our industry".
xxx for xxxx and also <eol> for xxx other companies <eob> that I xxxx worked with <eob> change xxx <eob>
a year, we completely blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> product, channels and IT.
Three # thousand employees xxxx reorganized <eol> xxxx 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So of xxxxxxx people <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx # with product people <eob> xxx xxxxxxxxx with engineers, <eob> x person and an engineer <eol> were now members # of the same team. <eob>
You # could be x member of a team <eol> responsible # for account opening <eob> or xxx the mobile # banking app, <eob>
At the xxxxxxx date <eol> of that new organization, <eob> some # people shaking xxxxx <eob> for the very first time, <eob> only xx find out that # they had # been sitting two <eob> minutes # xxxx from other <eol> but they were # sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for xxx last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone # saying, <eob> "Ah, so xxxxxx xxx guy xxxx I <eol> was always chasing for answers". <eob> xxxxxxxxxx
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together # xxxxx day. <eob>
If the product guy has # an idea, <eol> he can just raise # it <eob> get input from the engineer <eol> who # is sitting right # next xx him. <eob>
They can to # test <eol> with # customers immediately -- <eob> no # no PowerPoints, no red # tape, <eob> just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, # getting there is not easy. <eob>
as it xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> exactly the right # question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to # do so, we need all # the xxxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxx for that decision <eob> xx the team. <eob>
And this xxxxxx difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> xxx # are in different buildings, <eob> different cities # or even <eol> countries today? <eob>
Or should xx xxxxxx in xxxxxx videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do # things across these teams? <eob>
We still need some kind <eol> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all changes to structure <eol> and # process and procedure -- <eob> they are xxx easy. <eob>
But xx the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own <eob>
Let try xx illustrate. <eob>
If we want <eol> these teams be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, # like # mini-start-up, <eob> they # have # to be xxxxxxxxx and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot # have leaders <eol> commanding their xxxxxx what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do.
No <eob> micromanagers. <eob>
But it also means xxxx # each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal title. <eol>
It's about all of us stepping <eol> to # initiative. <eob>
Now xxxxxxxxxx we also cannot <eob> to have all these # teams <eol> running # in xxxxxxxxx # directions, <eob> because that would <eol> xxxxxxxxx lead xx chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment # autonomy <eol> at the same xxxxx <eob> just a of <eob> birds. <eob>
In xx organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> xxxx each new # behavior, <eob> there is # giving up <eol> xx something xxx as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx aligned around <eol> the overall # purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall -- the what. <eob>
But then # they have to # go <eol> and trust xxxxx <eob> to # make the right decisions <eol> on how to get # there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But # you # know how they say <eol> information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some # managers, <eob> sharing may # <eob> feel if <eol> xxxxxx up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just xxxxxxxxx <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and # transparently as well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and the end # of every <eol> they # organize # a demo session <eob> to <eob> share xxx output <eol> of what they've done, # transparently. <eob>
xxxxx day, <eob> xxxx member of gives an xxxxxx <eob> of what <eob> they are working individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable xxx because suddenly, there is <eol> place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do is # transparent for # everyone. <eob>
So, alignment xx not easy, <eob> xxx autonomy <eol> is not so xxxxxxxx # either. <eol>
One executive at another # company <eob> likes xx explain how he used to xx <eol> a # of <eob>
Now, today, # know how things are going, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx at reports, <eob> he # needs walk down to the team floors <eol> to # attend xxx xxxxx sessions. <eob>
And instead of xxxxxxx people # what # to xxx <eob> # # ways to # help them. <eol>
That # is xxxxxxx change <eob> xxx someone # xxx # xxxx to be <eol> a of # milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # # old world, # this xxxxxxxxx # said, <eol> "I # had the # control. <eob>
xx <eob> reality, projects xxxxx run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much transparency, <eob> xxx I xxx course-correct much earlier # if needed". <eob>
xxx middle <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First # of xxxx the xxxxxxxxx <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> xxxxxxx less # of a xxxx <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in the there was <eol> this idea xx # thinkers and # doers. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx would # xxxx follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead # only <eol> managing other people, <eob> middle managers were expected to # become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for last 10 xxxxxx <eob> you have just been xxxxxxx <eol> # people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> xx xx things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
Clearly, xxxx is xxx for xxxxxxxxx <eob> and some great people the <eob>
But the result a xxx <eob> with # less xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And all # of # this # hard xxxxx <eob>
it's worth it. <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx that I worked with, they were used <eol> new product <eob> features # a xxx # times per year. <eol>
Now they every few # weeks, <eob> xxx without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And if # you the xxxxx <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just # feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels if # you're walking <eol> the halls # of a very large xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eol> xxxx <eob> cannot # claim xxxxxxx xxxx
But at least with this new xxxxxx <eob> they are # much <eob> better prepared <eol> to respond to change.
The is getting <eob> faster <eob> xxx more <eob> so xx need to reboot our way <eol> of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of # change <eob> is <eob> not # in structure <eob> or process or procedure, <eob> and it's xxxx # not just <eol> senior xxxxxxxxxx taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will # be all # <eol> xx the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question # is: <eob> What are you to # give up? <eob>
xxxxx you. <eol>

We're # coming # up on # over employees, <eol> xxx they # live everywhere, <eob> from California # to Mississippi, <eol> to where I <eob> live in Texas. <eob>
They're xxxx # in 67 countries. <eob>
xxxxxxx Mexico, # India, # New # Zealand. <eol>
Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a home base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether they <eob> are in RVs <eol> or traveling through xxxxxxxx <eob> they are in new xxxxxx <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they # can find good # Wi-Fi, <eob> care where are. <eob>
Our # on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally.
It # was conscious choice <eob> from # xxx xxxx beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't use the word # <eob> because sets up # the expectation, <eob> that # some xxxxxx are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> xx # an equal playing field. <eol>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is # the most effective xxx to build a <eob>
The key is you have # xx <eol> it consciously. <eob>
xxxx xx WordPress, <eob> many of xxx 20 hires people I'd xxxxx met in person. <eob>
But collaborated # online, <eol> sometimes # for years. <eob>
I wanted xx continue <eol> xxx one simple reason. <eob>
x believe talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. But xxxxxxxxxxx is xxxx <eob>
In # Silicon # xxxxxxx <eob> big tech # companies # <eob> from essentially <eol> the xxxx small # pond or bay. <eol>
A distributed company <eol> can fish # xxxx the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone # who grew up <eol> xx Japan but lives # in California, <eob> xxx can # gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to # sleep <eol> wherever they are in the <eob> bring a different <eol> understanding of xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and a # different # lived experience. <eob>
At # the base of the # decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's xxxxxx to people autonomy <eob> they do # their work. <eob>
Unless # # in a role <eol> where <eob> # specific are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> you can # make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can # have a # corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they xxxx to eat, <eob> you can choose there's xxxxx <eol> and when there's silence. <eol>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You save xxx time xxxxx spend commuting <eob> xxx put xx into things <eol> that are important to # you. <eob>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is a technology company. <eol>
But people # xxxxx ask me, "This works # great for y'all, <eol> but xxxx about everyone else?" If have # office, <eob> you xxx a # few things <eol> to # build distributed # capability.
First: # document everything. <eob>
an office, easy to make decisions # the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in <eob>
But if people # work remotely <eob> and some of <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't # have access to, <eob> see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding why.
Always leave a trail of where you were <eol> and what you were thinking about. <eob>
This to pick up <eol> where you xxxx off.
xx allows people in # different <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great xx think about <eol> as an organization evolves, xxxxxx and # joining. <eob>
Try to # have # xx much communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
xxxx everything's and xxxxxxx <eol> it allows new people to # catch quickly. <eob>
You also # xxxx to find the right <eob>
There are # so many apps and # services <eol> that help xxxx day-to-day # <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # changed how # you <eol> probably aren't objects xxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # things you access <eol> your computer. <eob>
So # with <eob> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
# productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional # office, <eob> xxxxxx in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out xx the year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks apart.
We try to flip that: <eob> we come xxxxxxxx <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once x year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the # entire company comes xxxxxxxx # for a xxxxx <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is connecting people. <eob> xx xx xxxx sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on same # <eob> and they have a xxxxxx # connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work # together <eol> the rest of # the xxxxx <eob> xxxx can bring # together <eol> # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every # person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that # <eol> towards a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> or just to buy coffee, so they don't <eol> get kicked xxx # of the coffee shop. <eob>
One xxxxx in Seattle <eol> to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a xxxxxxxxx # fishing pier. <eob>
Each joins # xxx company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eol>
This they can invest <eol> in getting # the right chair, xxxxxxxx <eob> the right desk setup, so can have <eol> the # productive environment xxx them. <eob>
Today, # there are # just a few # companies <eob> that distributed # first. <eob>
In a decade or # two, <eol> I that percent companies <eol> that # are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eob> xxx going to function # way. <eob>
will xxxxxx to distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by xxxxx are. <eob>
xx you think xxxxx <eol> what you're to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eob> give # people xx # live and work <eob> where they # they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it xx that you're creating xxxxxxxxx <eob>
