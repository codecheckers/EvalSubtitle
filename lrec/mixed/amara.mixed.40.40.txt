Welcome to the world # of <eob> cyberharassment.
xxxx of harassment women <eob> face xx # Pakistan is very <eob> and leads to <eob> # sometimes deadly <eob>
This kind <eol> of harassment keeps women <eol> accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's x # form of oppression. <eol>
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eol> mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 percent penetration. <eob>
And this number # doesn't seem <eob> # <eob> # go down <eol> with xxx rise of new # technologies. <eol>
Pakistan also <eol> the birthplace <eol> of the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eob> Malala #
But just xxx of Pakistan. <eob>
Another # aspect is where the twisted xxxxxxx of <eob> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are to disrespect women <eob> and even them xxxxxxxxx <eob> in the name of so-called "family <eob> where # women are left # die right # <eob> outside their houses for # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx <eob> in # xxx name of "family honor". <eob>
# me say very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eob> a # murder.
I come from a xxxx # small village <eol> xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eob> where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
elders of xx family <eol> didn't allow # xxxxx women <eob> to xxxxxx their higher # education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx # the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was # who really <eob> supported # my #
To get law xxxxxxx <eol> of course, # really difficult, <eob> and [there frowns of disapproval. <eob>
xxx the end, <eob> I xxxx <eol> it's either # me or xxxxx <eob> and chose myself. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx family's traditions <eol> and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to a mobile <eol> phone until married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eol> this became a <eob> tool <eob> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eob> and # threw me of xxx house, <eob> xxxxx my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time <eol> when I xxxxx asked myself, <eob>
Why are # women not to enjoy xxx xxxx equal rights <eob> enshrined # in our # Constitution?
While # xxx <eob> xxxxxx # that a woman <eol> has xxx same # xxxxx xxxxxx <eob> the # information, why is it # always men xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eol> who # are xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, <eob> effectively making # the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to # take a step, <eob> instead keep questioning <eol> # patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eol>
And I the Digital # Rights Foundation # in # 2012 <eob> to address all xxx issues <eol> xxx women's experiences in <eol> online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for xxxx and safe # internet <eob> convincing young women <eob> that access # to the <eob> safe internet <eol> is fundamental, basic, <eol> # human right, I'm trying # to play part <eob> xx igniting spark to address <eol> the questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eob>
With # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to <eob> offer a <eob> solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December <eob> # 2016 -- <eol> <eob>
to support xxx # xxxxx <eol> who # xx know who to xxxx to <eob> when # they face serious threats online.
I of the women # <eol> who do xxx have <eol> the necessary <eob> to deal the mental trauma <eol> # feel unsafe in online # <eob> xxxx go xxxxx their xxxxx activities, <eob> thinking xxxx there # # rape # threat in # their in-box. <eob>
Safe # access <eob> to xxx internet <eob> is xx access to knowledge, <eob> and is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's rights, <eob> xxx fighting xxx equality. <eob>

(Applause) <eob>
xx a critical moment. <eol>
Our leaders, some # of our great institutions <eol> xxx failing us.
xxxx <eol>
xx cases, it's because <eob> they're bad <eob> or unethical, xxx often, they've xxxxx us <eol> to the xxxxx objectives. <eol>
is unacceptable. <eob>
This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # <eob> xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eob> to xxxxxx the right <eob>
xxx <eob> going to # be easy. <eob>
For # years, # I've worked with talented # teams <eob> and they've chosen xxx right objectives <eol> xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today <eob> I'm going to # share with you <eob> what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- xxxxxx what's <eob> how and # <eob> they xxx meaningful # audacious <eol> goals, <eol> the xxxxx # goals xxx the right # reasons. <eol>
Let's # go # back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, # is # me. <eob>
I've got a to xxxxxx I'm x computer <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> I'm under # xxxx Grove, <eol> been called the manager <eob> of his # or any xxxxx era. <eob>
Andy was a leader <eol> xxx also a <eol> # teacher, <eob> and he # # to me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know. <eob>
Execution is xxxx matters the
And so # x # xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off <eol> the xxxxxxx doesn't # it? <eob>
And it's all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eol>
So <eob> # here's # # classic video from 1970s <eob> xx professor Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) # Andy Grove: # The xxx key # phrases xx the <eol> management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The # key results have to measured, <eob> the end you can look <eol> and without xxx argument say, <eob> "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system <eob> and <eol> they work for organizations, <eol> they work xxx teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eol>
xxx # are <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key are # how <eol> I'm going to get # xxxx # done.
Objectives. Key <eob>
What and # how. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many <eob> xx us are setting # goals wrong, <eob> xxx most us <eol> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eob>
lot of organizations <eob> xxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx and meet them. <eob>
They ship their xxxxxx <eol> they introduce their # products, <eob> they make xxxxx numbers, but # they lack a sense xx to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # you set <eob> these goals the right <eob>
First, # you must answer <eol> xxx "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because transformational teams <eol> combine <eol> their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion and to their purpose, <eob> xxx they <eol> develop # a clear <eol> and xxxxxxxxxx sense xx why.
I to you a story. <eob>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eol>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna is a health care company. <eob>
And when xxx founded, <eol> they used data # to serve the # health <eol> lots xx workers at large <eob>
And two years <eol> into the life, the # federal government <eob> issued a <eol> to build the first # ever cloud database <eob>
Now, xxxxxx # remember <eol> that is that # program <eol> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> xxx xxxxxx with disabilities. <eol>
Nuna at # the xxxx # xxx # just # <eob> xx <eob> xxx database <eol> had to be built # xx xxx year, <eob> and <eob> they xxx xxxxx set commitments <eol> they had to honor, <eob> xxx frankly, they weren't # going # <eob> xx make <eob> very much money on <eol> the <eob>
This # was a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini # seized xxx <eob>
jumped # at # opportunity. xxx did not flinch.
xxxx <eob>
Well, xxxx a # xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism.
And # when he xxx seven, <eob> xx had xxx xxx seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eol>
# xxxx ground. <eol> He <eob>
Jini's are xxxxxx immigrants. <eol>
They came to # the xxxxxxx <eol> with # resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it up # xx # xxxx <eol> to enroll family # in Medicaid. <eob>
was nine xxxxx <eol> xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, xxx that xxxxxxx bid on, won <eol> xxx delivered on that # contract. <eob>
Here's Jini # to tell # you xxxx <eob>
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eol> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today it provides for and millions of # others. <eob>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid.
Every # row of is a life <eob> whose story # <eol> deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eol>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us <eob> that compelling why <eol> can the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to have accomplished. <eol>
objectives are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> they are <eol> xxx they're a <eol> # kind of vaccine <eol> xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You <eol> # think a rockstar <eob> be <eob> an unlikely xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eob> but for years, <eob> Bono # used xxxx <eol> to # xxxx # a global war <eol> xxxxxxx poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eol>
The # first is xxxx # relief for the # poorest countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is universal access <eol> to drugs. <eob>
Now, why <eob> these good objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back xx # our # checklist. <eob>
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented?
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate? <eob>
How <eob>
# xxxxxxx does passion <eol> xxxx xxx # to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a perfect # rhyme with the head, then # passion means <eol>
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eob> the chemistry # contained # inside # <eol> xxx <eob>
gives # us # for <eol> risk, <eol> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable <eob>
And when xxx have that sort <eob> # structure xxx environment <eob> and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner.
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eob> and magic # is right # the corner. <eol>
xxxx is perfect. <eol>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # key <eob> results. <eob> That's xxx # we <eob> meet # our <eol>
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound. <eol>
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx # realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx <eob> and they're verifiable. <eob>
# xxx xxxx key # results. <eol>
In xxxxx introduced OKRs to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and Sergey. <eob>
xxxx they are, <eol> # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eob>
he really xxxx was, <eob> "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eol> (Laughter) <eob>
And I took xxxx as a <eob> kind of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, every Googler has written down <eol> # objectives and xxx key <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've xxxxxxxxx them for everyone to xxxx <eol>
these xxx xxxx <eol> for bonuses # or for promotions. <eob>
xxxxxxx # set # aside. <eol>
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eob> and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on <eob> an objective <eob> xxxxx was to # build <eol> the next client <eob> platform the future of web applications -- <eol> in other xxxxx the browser. <eol>
# very <eol> thoughtful <eol> how # he chose <eol> his # key # results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
could xx clicks # or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going to decide Chrome a # great <eob> or not. <eob>
So he had this # one <eol> three-year-long # objective: <eob> build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And then every # year <eol> he xxxxx to the xxxx # key # results, <eob> of users, he upped the # ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx and he missed it.
He xxx less than 10. <eob>
Second <eol> year, he raised <eob> the bar # to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat <eob>
In the xxxxx # year, <eob> he the ante once # xxxx to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx # an <eob> marketing <eob> campaign, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx improved # the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eob>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx
xxx I like story, <eob> not so # xxx the # xxxxx ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx <eol> carefully choosing the objective <eol> and then xxxxxxxx to it <eob> year <eob> # after xxxx after
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eob>
Now, I think of # OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eol> and xxxx of our # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters xx # the why <eol> that we xxxx into those # vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be <eol> for a strong culture <eob> or # for stronger leadership, <eol> # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, <eol> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eol>
I # to think <eol> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment.
Do you # # right <eob>
xxxx xxxx xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do <eol> it xxxxxx <eob>
If you'd some feedback # them, <eol> you can send <eob> # to # me. <eob>

If think xx world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a <eob> # Nuna, xx of Google, <eob> they're # remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable xxxxxx <eob> high-quality for <eob> ending global <eob> poverty, <eol> access # to all xxx # information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eol> xx powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been xxxxxx <eol> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eol> xxx I want you <eol> to join # me in this <eob> movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because <eob> we can # take xxxx <eob> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
We can take them to # families, <eob> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments. <eob>

We can transform # those informations.
We can back on the track <eob> if we can and # do measure <eol> what really xxxxxxxx <eob>
# you.
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
What # history? <eob>
It is # something written by the winners.
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eob> should be # focused on xxxxxxx <eob> like # Lenin # or <eol>
xx a result, people <eol> xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something <eol> xxxx <eob> was predetermined <eol> or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could not <eob> influence it in xxx way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia could been <eob> will a truly # democratic xxxxxxx # this is due # to the way <eob> history has been framed <eob> xxx # Russia. <eob>
And this <eol> is true. <eob>
To prove # it, # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx <eob> to xxx <eol> year <eob> the xxxx of the Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if internet <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx <eol> x social network xxx <eob> dead # people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My team and x created # our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded <eol> all possible # real diaries and letters <eob> written <eol> by more than 3,000 xxxxxx <eob> 100 ago. <eob>
So any user of <eol> our website or can # follow a xxxx feed <eol> for each day 1917 <eob> xxx read what people xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, <eob> xxxxx xx # Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eol>
We <eob> watch all personalities <eol> being xxxxxx like you and me, <eob> xxx demigods, # we see that history # <eob> of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # only <eol> their "genius ideas". <eol>
xxxxxxx # was a for many Russians, <eob> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could <eob> # never have prevailed, <eob> just <eob> # because xxxxxxxxx <eol> was xxx our destiny. <eob>
xxx if we # take broader <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, # xxxx # led to of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But this project, we # <eob> xxx that Russia <eol> have # had a # different history <eob> and a xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx
the posts xxxx # <eol> you learn that Russia xxx the # first # country # in the to abolish the death <eob> penalty, <eob> or xxx of the xxxxx # ones to grant women # voting rights.
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced # <eol> history <eob> can help a better because history is just a rehearsal <eol> what's happening xxxxx now.
We xx need new telling history, <eob> and xxxxx xxx example, <eob> we started # a new online # project that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> xxx that # is # an online series <eob> that # you an impression <eol> of year, <eob> a # year by social change <eob> that, many ways, the <eob> # world as we xxxx it <eob>
But we # <eob> making that history xxxxx by xxxx if xxx the main <eol> could xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals <eob> were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting for the values, no if they lived <eol> in US or in USSR <eob> or xx France or xx # China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By xxxxxxxx history <eob> in <eob> such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> through # media, <eob> we show that people in # <eol> are not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eob>
gives any user a possibility <eol> xx reclaiming <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an

Computer algorithms today <eol> xxx performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> with accuracies, a xxxxxxx <eol> using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

AI # xx <eob> poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on xxx lives in the future. <eol>
Today, however, <eol> we still face xxxxxxx challenges in detecting and several life-threatening illnesses, such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eol>
of patients every xxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> due to xxxxx and # oral cancer. <eob>
best # way to # help these patients is to # perform <eol> early # detection and diagnoses of these # diseases. <eob>
So how do # we detect today, <eol> and can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx help? <eob>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eob> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first <eob> expensive medical imaging # technologies <eol> xxxx as imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, xxxxxxx expert physician then diagnoses <eol> # talks xx # the patient. <eol>
As you # xxx see, this is a very resource-intensive process, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # # expert # physicians, expensive imaging technologies, <eob> xxx # is not # considered practical <eol> the developing xxxxxx <eob>
And in fact, in many <eob> industrialized # nations, xx <eob>
So, can we solve # this # problem <eol> using artificial intelligence?
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence # architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- repeat, on an order # <eob> of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eob> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After xxxxx I would then # go <eol> an expert <eob> would # then analyze <eol> those images for # me. <eob>
And # using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> I can # a # standard deep neural network <eob> or a deep learning <eob> to # provide # xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> approaches suffer from the same # problem. <eob>
xxxxx # amounts xx xxxxx # expert # <eob> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these important problems facing us today?
And this is exactly <eob> what xx group # at MIT Media xxxxx <eob>
We variety <eol> xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx solve xxxx xx the most important <eol> challenges facing us # in medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In the # example I shared <eol> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eob> we wanted xx # reduce <eob> of medical imaging technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
our first goal, <eob> xx starting <eol> xxxx # tens and <eob> thousands <eob> these very expensive medical images, <eol> xxxx traditional <eob> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx
xxxx xxxx image, my team and I figured out a very clever # way <eob> to extract # billions <eol> xx information packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eob> colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and <eob> rendering # of xxxxxxx <eob> on the # medical image. <eob>
In a # we # one image <eol> xxxx # billions xx training data points, <eol> massively reducing xx data <eol> needed for
xxx our goal, to # the # use of # expensive medical <eol> imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light <eob> acquired either # from a # camera <eob> or x mobile # phone, xxx the patient. <eob>
Then remember those billions # of <eob> information # packets? <eob>
xx overlaid xxxxx from <eol> xxxxxxx image onto # this image, <eob> something <eol> that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much to xxx surprise, <eol> we xxxx required <eob> -- I only 50 -- <eob> these images # <eol> our algorithms # xxxx # efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using # <eol> very medical # images, we now train the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard # <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> and # xxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and provide xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the future and even right <eob> now, <eob> some very simple, # white light <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx from the <eob> instead <eol> # of expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies.
I believe that # xx # <eol> to <eob> enter xx # era <eob> where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make <eol> impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think that thinking <eol> xxxxx traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eob> about # unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which can accept xxxxxxx of data <eob> and xxxxx some xx the most xxxxxxxxx <eob> problems facing # us today, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx in health care. <eob>

Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and break your xxxxxx <eol> xxx try xxx tape it together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but it not be <eol> in xxxx # functional way, <eob> # <eob> we'll get a <eol>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, <eob> xxx muscle fat cells inside of it, <eob> and # if there's # <eol> fat in # our muscle, isn't as <eob>
Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eob> xxx body # grow back <eob> without # scars <eob> and look like # what it was before we were even # <eob>
I'm working to create <eob> that give xx # the signals <eol> to new tissue <eob> by # the <eob> immune response.
We know that # time <eol> a # material is xxxxxxxxx # body, <eob> the immune # xxxxxxx # xx # <eob> it. <eob>
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # xxxxx new
when I place material, <eol> scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system # creates <eol> small # environment of cells and proteins <eob> xxxx can change xxx # way <eol> that # our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> our xxxxx # activities, <eob> like going for a run <eob> or inside binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that our # stem cells # xxxx # and # develop. <eob>
If we xxxx the wrong signals, say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eob> we get xxx cells instead of muscle. <eob>
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eol> of a variety of different # <eob> plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> materials, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, <eob> that are more or less porous, <eob> gels different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even <eob> xxxx materials <eob> release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So # in xxxxxx # orchestrate <eol> xxxxxxxx show cells <eol> xx # giving them the correct stage, cues and props <eob> # can # be changed # for different tissues, <eob> just # like a producer xxxxx change the set <eob> for # "Les # Mis" versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx combining specific # of signals <eob> that xxxxx our body to injury <eol> to help us # regenerate.
the <eob> xxxxxxx we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eob> a moldable filler <eol> even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't # to wake up xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx xx able to heal Wolverine.
Probably xxx next # Tuesday, either.
But with these # advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx # with our immune system <eob> to help and <eol> heal wounds, <eol> could xxxxx xxxxxx products # the market <eol> xxxx work with our <eob> body's defense system <eob> xx # help us <eob> regenerate, <eob> and maybe day be # able <eol> # keep pace xxxx a salamander. <eob>

So, <eob> as # a child, <eob> I <eob> used # to spend # of xx # time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, # humid, summer # days, I dash # the # floor <eob> and xxxxx my xxxx front # of <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> a privileged # <eob> xxx xxx community. <eob>
Growing stories next-door xxxxxxxxx <eob> having xx set <eol> up fake energy accounts or xxxxxx <eob> seemed normal # <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get <eob> xx xxxxxxxxx would xxxx no choice <eob> but # to # the <eol> after their heat # was xxxx off, <eob> xxxx # keep their # family <eol> comfortable one # day. <eob>
These xx dangerous <eol> incidents # can take root when people are # xxxxx <eol> with choices. <eol>
In the US, xxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> percent of their # income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and rural xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can spend # 20, even xx percent <eol> of their income on xxxxxxx <eob>
2015, xxxx caused over <eol> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx xx provide power to # their homes. <eob>
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden. <eob>
xxxxxx burdens are # so xxxx <eol> xxxx just x number.
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to her # flu medicine, <eob> xx do # you feed her? <eob>
Or do you # keep her <eob>
xxxx an choice, <eob> and # month, <eob> seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy. <eob>
This a xxxx <eol> # larger <eol> and systemic xxxxxx <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people xx <eob> color, <eob> who spend xxxx xxx xxxx <eol> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eol> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass <eol> of 37 million xxxxxx # a xxxx <eob> who are xxxxxx to xxxxxx energy for # xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those <eob> # with <eol> high energy # burdens <eob> have # a greater likelihood # of conditions <eol> like # heart disease and # asthma. <eol>
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, we have the tools to # xxxxxxx these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eob>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology <eol> are # decreasing. <eob>
even as we <eob> the majority of xxxxx who own # much more # than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when # I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
# is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities, <eob> utilities and # xxxxxxxxxx alike <eol> provide <eol> to # energy, <eob> energy energy technology. <eob>
But # there's <eob> no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in # the xxxxx <eol> of # local in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect <eol> of relationships. <eob>
So xx by working <eob> directly <eol> the communities <eob> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx <eol>
We host <eol> and events # for communities <eol> to # xxxxxx poverty, <eob> and how making even updates to their homes <eob> like xxxxxx insulation windows <eob> and heaters <eob> # go # x long way # xx # maximize efficiency. <eol>
We're connecting <eol> to community # solar <eol> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart # home research <eol> and # installation xxxxxxxx <eol> to help families bring # down <eol> their <eol> # bills. <eob>
We're xxxx working # directly <eol> with elected <eol> # <eob> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of # energy and resilience <eob> we have to xxxx together sustainably.
Now, the US # spends <eol> over # three billion a year energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eol> millions # xxxxxxx xxx they're only able xx help <eol> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx <eob> there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But # by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eol> we can assure and impartial access <eob> to energy that clean, <eob> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At # scale, microgrid technology, <eob> xxx energy efficiency <eol> dramatically # <eob> improve xxxxxx health. <eob>
And for those xxxx # high burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent xx their income -- <eob> xx # percent of a person's income struggling to make xxxx # meet. <eob>
xxxx is <eob> life-changing. <eob>
This is xx for # use # their energy savings <eob> to sponsor their <eol> future. <eob>
I xxxxx <eol> # back to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eol> xxx impossible choices <eol> xxxx # they xxxx <eob> and the effect it had on xxxxx <eob>

There are xxxxxxxx nationwide # having <eol> to make the # same xxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
And # high energy burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but through relationships <eob> with <eob> communities technology, <eol> we have # the paths to overcome them. <eob>

xxxx # ever watched <eol> a flock birds work <eol>

xxxx # I <eol> find remarkable # is that these # birds <eol> would not be able to do # that <eol> if they all would <eol> to follow <eob> one <eol>

Their # alignment enables their <eob> # their <eol> xxxxx # fast and xxxxxxxxx
Now, what does this have to xx <eol> with xxx one # us? <eob>
it's # one xxx # of illustrating # what <eol> I xxxxxxx to xx the # most xxxxxxxxx change <eob> that needed in ways of xxxxxxx <eob>
The world # is # getting faster <eol> and more <eob> complex, <eob> so we # need a # way of working, <eob> a way # xxxx # xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # purpose, <eob> xxxx takes out xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> that xxxxx empowers people <eol> to make faster. <eol>
But # the # question is: In # order # to # get <eob> there, <eob> are xx # willing to # xxxx up? <eob>
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eob> that wanted to # embark <eol> a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their offering to be # <eol> intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm xxx sure how many of you <eob> # a # <eob> bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate <eol> # xxxx <eob> traditional banks like. <eol>
You see lots # <eob> of people # suits <eol> taking elevators xx go <eol> to department, <eob> sitting with marketers, <eob> xxxxxxxxx with engineers, # etc.
You see meetings # 20 # people <eob> nothing gets
Great xxxxxx They <eol> end up <eob> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eob>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx
this # xxxx xxxx in to transform, <eob> would have xx # improve <eol> time to market <eob> by changing <eob> their ways xx working as well. <eol>
But xxxx <eob>
To <eob> # get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx <eol> to xxx have x look companies <eob> that seem # to xx more innovative, <eob> like Google, Spotify, Zappos.
And remember how we xxxx # <eol> the halls at xxx xx these # <eob> companies in # December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx and a xxxx # xx bankers. <eob>
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eob> surrounded <eol> # by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we # asked, <eol> xxxx # is # your <eob> company organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx <eob> to # get org # chart. <eol>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny # names like # <eol> and # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx explain how xxxx were organized. <eob>
So then tried to # <eol> that # our own world. <eol>
We # xxxxxx "How many # people <eol> are xxxxxxx for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who you xxxxxx <eol> to?" <eob> depends". <eol>
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" <eob> xxx depends". <eob>
You can our surprise.
xx were # xxxxxx for what we thought <eol> xx the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx
Now, over the # course # of that day, <eol> we gained <eol> understanding of #
They believed in xxx power <eob> of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups. <eol>
They xxx product people <eol> engineers <eob> in the same team so they could # design, build <eol> and # test ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx <eol> independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eob>
xxxx # did not <eol> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They all the skills needed there in the team. <eob>
xxxx # at end of that day, <eob> xx had a to <eob> reflect xx what we # had learned. <eob>
And we started to # xxxx # their <eob> so # we already thinking xx how <eob> xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eol>
then, one # of the hosts, <eol> guy # who # had not # said a word # all # he suddenly xxxxx <eob> xxx x see you <eol> like xxx model. <eob>
But I # have one for # you: <eob> What # are you to give xxxx <eob> we willing # to <eol> give up? <eob>
xxx not # xxxx # an answer immediately, <eol> xxx we # knew # xx was right.
Change is only about <eol> xxxxxxxxx the xxxx it's about <eob> giving <eol> some of old as well. <eob>
Now, over # the # past years, <eob> I worked with companies all # xxxx # the world <eob> to change their <eol> xxxx xx # working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has xxx skeptics <eob> about why this is xxxxx xx for them. <eob>
"Our # is more complex," <eol> or # have <eol> the xxxxxx # xx # like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eob> in our # industry".
xxx for xxxx bank and also for the other companies <eob> xxxx x # have worked with change was possible. <eob>
a year, # we <eol> up old silos <eob> between # marketing, <eol> product, channels and xxx <eol>
Three # employees # were <eol> into 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams. <eob>
So instead of product people sitting just with # people <eob> engineers engineers, <eob> x product # person and <eob> an engineer <eol> xxxx now xxxxxxx of xxx xxxxx <eob>
You could be a xxxxxx of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for xxx mobile # banking app, xxxx <eol>
At the go-live date <eol> of xxxx new organization, <eob> people were xxxxxxx hands <eob> for # very # xxxxx # time, only to find xxx xxxx been <eol> xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from # each other <eob> but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # reports for last 10 years.
You hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, you're # the guy # that I <eol> xxxxxx chasing for <eob> answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee <eol> xxxxxxxx every <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, he can just # raise # it <eol> to get input from <eob> the engineer <eol> xxx # is # sitting right next # to him. <eob>
They xxxxxx test <eol> with customers immediately # -- <eob> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # <eol> no xxx <eol> tape, <eob> just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# getting there is not # <eol> easy. <eob>
And # it # turns out, are # you <eob> willing to give up?" <eob> is # exactly # right # to xxxx
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
xxxxxxx # of <eob> going <eol> up xxx # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx want # xxx team to # decide.
xx do we need xxx the skills <eol> and for xxxx <eob> in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eol> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eol> different xxxxxxxxx # today? <eob>
xx should we invest in better videoconferencing? <eob>
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx in the way xx # things <eob> across # <eob> xxxxxx <eob>
We still need some xxxx <eol> of management xxxxxxx <eob>
# these changes to structure <eol> and process procedure -- <eob> they xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> x found the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let xx try to illustrate. <eob>
If we # these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx <eol> commanding their people xxxx to do, when to # do, # how # xxx <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But # it also # each employee <eol> needs to become leader, <eob> regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's # about all of # us up <eol> to take xxxxxxxxxxx
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eol> to have all # teams <eol> xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> because # that would <eol> certainly lead # to chaos. <eob>
# we need and # autonomy <eol> at <eol> # same <eob> just xxxx a flock # of birds. <eob>
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and # each new behavior, <eol> there xx <eol> on something as # well. <eol>
Leaders have to # make sure <eol> xxxx everyone # in xxx organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose the why and the -- what. <eob>
But # then xxxx xxxx let go <eol> # trust their # teams <eob> to the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to get # there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eob>
But you know # how say <eol> that information is a source of xxxxxx
Well, for some managers, xxxxxxx information may feel as # if they're giving up xxxx power. <eob>
xxx it's # not just managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
these # the <eob> # xxxxx <eob> typically work in short # sprints, <eob> and at the end # # sprint, <eol> they organize # a demo session <eob> xx share # the output <eol> of # what they've done, transparently. <eob>
xxxx <eol> each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working xx <eob>
Now, all this transparency be uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eob> xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do <eol> xx transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eob> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive # at # another company <eob> to explain he used to be <eob> a master <eol> of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how # <eob> xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eob> instead <eol> of looking at # status reports, <eob> he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # the team floors <eol> attend one of their sessions. <eob>
xxx instead of # telling people what xx <eob> looks # ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change for # someone # <eol> who used # xx be <eol> master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eol>
In xxxxxxxx many # projects would run over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
xxx I have # more # transparency, <eob> I can course-correct much # earlier if needed". <eob>
And managers <eol> need to # change as well. <eob>
First # of all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was <eol> this idea of thinkers and # <eob>
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx instead xx only <eol> managing other # people, middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches. <eob>
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, <eol> you have just been <eob> other people what to xxx <eob> but now xxxxxx expected <eol> to # # # again. <eob>
Clearly, this model <eol> is not for everyone, <eob> and great <eob> people # leave the # company. <eob>
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eol> with less hierarchy. <eob>
xxx of this is hard
xxx # it's worth it. <eob>
xxx companies that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx <eol> new # features # few times <eob>
xxx they <eol> have releases every few # <eob> # without # xxxxxxxxx <eol> the xxx tape, <eob> whole xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And # if you walk the # halls <eol> xx these today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It # feels as if you're # xxxxxxx <eol> the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eol>
But at least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to # respond to <eob>
xxxxx is getting faster <eob> and more # xxxxxxxx <eob> so we # need # to reboot # our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change is not # structure <eob> or process # <eob> and xxxx also not <eol> senior taking charge. <eob>
Leaders xx <eob> all of those <eol> in # the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
all have # <eol> to <eol> lead the # change. <eob>
# the question xxx <eob> What are you willing to give # <eob>

xx long as <eob> they can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a <eob> conscious choice <eol> from the very # beginning. <eob>
Notice x don't xxx xxx word # "remote," <eol> because it sets up the expectation, xxxx some are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
use xxx word "distributed" <eol> xxxxxxxx # what we <eob> do, <eob> where everyone xx <eol> on # xxxxxxx field. <eob>
I think a # distributed workforce <eob> is # most effective xxx <eol> to # company. <eob>
The key is you have to <eol> # consciously.
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, many of # xxx first <eol> # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years. <eob>
I # wanted to continue xxxx <eol> for one # reason. <eob>
I believe # that talent and <eol> are equally distributed the world. <eob> is # not. <eol>
In <eol> the tech xxxxxxxxx fish <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> the # same # small or xxxx <eob>
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx fish from # the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # <eob> who # grew up <eol> in xxxxx # but lives in California, <eob> # can gain someone who xxxxxx <eol> works, <eol> wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are xx # world. <eol> They bring a # <eol> understanding # of xxxx # culture <eob> and # a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of xxx decision <eol> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # how # xxxx do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a <eol> where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, <eol> you <eob> can make your # <eob> own schedule. <eob>
Everyone <eob> have a xxxxxx office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you # can choose there's music <eob> xxx when silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> the xxxx should be.
You can save the time <eol> spend commuting and put xx into things <eol> that important xx <eob>
A # distributed workforce is ideal a # company. <eob>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, <eob> "This works for y'all, <eol> xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # an # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx # do # few xxxxxx <eol> to # build distributed <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In xx it's easy <eol> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, <eob> in the kitchen, # in xxx <eob>
But <eob> if # people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eol> are having <eob> conversations <eob> they xxxxx xxxx access they'll these xxxxxxxxx <eob> being made <eol> without understanding the xxxx <eob>
Always leave x trail # of xxxxx you were <eob> and what xxx were thinking about. <eob>
This # allows others pick xx you # left off. <eob>
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eol> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> it's great to think <eol> as # an organization <eob> people and xxxxxx
have as much communication <eol> as possible xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows # people up <eob>
You xxxx xxxx to find <eol> xxx # <eob>
There xxx so xxxx apps <eob> and xxxxxxxx <eol> that help # with day-to-day communication, xxxxx <eob> conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The things # that changed how # you xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx aren't objects # anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So xxxxxxxxxx with xxxxxxxxx <eol> tools that enable # collaboration, <eob> see what works.
Create productive, face-to-face # time. <eob>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place <eol> xx <eob> weeks <eob> out of the year <eob> and you # might <eol> three four # xxxxx apart. <eob>
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> a # year xx # do a grand # xxxxx xxx entire company <eob> comes for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary <eob> goal is people. <eob> xxxx to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and <eob> on xxxx <eob> page, <eol> and xxxx <eob> xxxx # a <eob> deeper <eol> xxxx their # colleagues. <eol>
When they work # <eol> the rest xx the year, <eob> they can bring together <eol> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy.
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx their # own work environment. <eob>
Every person # at Automattic has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx put <eol> towards a co-working # xxxxx <eob> or to buy so # they don't <eol> out of <eob> xxx coffee shop. <eob>
One # in Seattle <eob> xx pool their stipends <eob> together <eob> and rented a # on x xxxxxxx pier.
Each xxxxxx who # joins company gets x home-office stipend. <eob>
xxxx # is money can invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # right # chair, <eob> monitor, <eob> # right xxxx so # they can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eob>
Today, there are just a # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx <eob>
In <eol> a decade or # xxxx <eol> x predict <eol> that 90 percent of companies <eol> that are to be # changing <eol> the # course of xxx xxxxx <eob> are <eol> going function way. <eob>
They will to be distributed # first, <eol> or # they'll # be replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx xxxxx what you're # going xx xxxxx next, <eob> consider xxx # you can tap <eol> into # global talent, <eob> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and <eob> work <eol> where they # feel they should <eol> and still <eol> # participate fully whatever <eob> it # is you're creating together. <eob>
