xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>

xxxxxx xxx must answer <eol> xxx question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
xxxxx transformational # teams <eob> combine ambitions <eob> to their xxxxxxx to their xxxxxxxx <eob> and they # develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>

I # <eol> work with x remarkable # <eob>
xxx name is # <eol> Kim. <eol>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
xxxx is # health care <eob>
And # xxxx Nuna # founded, <eob> they # used data to serve xxx health <eob> xxxxx xx xxxx of workers xx large
xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, <eol> the issued a proposal <eob> to <eob> build the # first # ever <eol> cloud database for # Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> xxxx # Medicaid # xx # program <eob> serves xx # million # Americans, <eob> our <eob> poor, # our children and # disabilities.
Nuna at the # time was xxxx people <eol> xxx this database to <eob> built in year, <eol> they xxx a whole set of <eol> that had to # honor, <eob> and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eob> very much the xxxxxxxx <eob>
This was x # bet-your-company # moment, and # Jini <eob> xxxxxx it. <eob>
xxxxxx # at # opportunity. <eol> She # did flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, it's a xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's # <eob> younger <eob> brother Kimong # xxx # xxxxxxx
xxx when # he seven, xx <eob> had <eob> # first grand xxx xxxxxxx Disneyland. <eob>
He the ground. <eol> stopped breathing. <eob>
xxxxxx # parents are Korean <eol>

That <eob> xxxxxx defined # # xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became her xxxxxxxx # that company bid on, <eol> # won <eol> and on that #
Here's # to <eob> tell # you why.
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my xxxxxx from <eob> today # it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of <eob> #
Nuna is xxxx <eob> letter Medicaid.
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx story xxxxxxxx to be # told with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eob> that a compelling <eob> sense why <eob> can <eol> be the launchpad # for # objectives.
Remember, that's # xx xxxx to xxxx # accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eob> xxxx # are inspiring, <eob> xxx # they're # x of vaccine <eol> against <eob> # # thinking. <eol>
You think a <eob> # rockstar would # be an unlikely user <eob> of Objectives Key Results, years, xxxx has used OKRs <eob> xx wage x global xxx against xxxxxxx and <eob> disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eol> focused # on two xxxxxx # gorgeous, <eol> objectives.
The # first xx debt relief <eob> for the xxxxxxx countries the world.
# next xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> anti-HIV # drugs. <eol>
Now, # why xxx these good objectives?
Let's xx # back to <eol> our checklist. <eol>
Significant? Check. Concrete? # Yes. <eob>
Yes. <eol>
<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eol>

What # is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners.

xx <eob> # prove it, I spent years <eob> of my life xxxxxx to go xxx # years xxxxx <eol> to # the xxxx 1917, <eol> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

We # # all # those personalities <eol> being # like me, not demigods, <eob> and we # see that history <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> # <eob> their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx not only their <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>

But # if # take xxxxxxx <eob> look, it's <eob> not that black and xxxxxx <eob>
1917 led # 70 years <eob> of communist xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this project, # we # xxx Russia <eob> could <eol> have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eol> xxx # a # <eol> xx any other country could or still can.
Reading # the posts 1917, <eol> you learn Russia <eob> was the # <eob> first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eob> or <eob> # <eol> xxx # of xxx first ones <eol> xx xxxxx # women voting # <eob>

xx do xxxx xxx # ways of telling # <eol> and this for example, we started # <eob> a xxx # online project xxxx is called 1968Digital.com, that # <eob> that gives an of that xxxxx xxxxx <eob> a xxxx # <eol> xxxxxx <eob> by xxxxxx social <eol> that, <eob> xx <eol> # many ways, <eob> created the as we know xx

And # xx # see xxxx a lot xx individuals <eol> xxxxxx the same challenges <eob> and were fighting for the xxxxxxx no # matter # if they xxxxx <eol> in xxx US # in # USSR <eol> or xxxxxx or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By # exposing history in xxxx # a democratic # way, <eob> through xxxxxx media, <eob> we <eob> show xxxx people power are not xxx only # making choices. <eob>

So how do we detect these <eob> diseases xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx # # diseases, <eob> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eol> very expensive <eob> xxxxxxx # imaging technologies as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx <eob> to be xxxxxxxxxx
are collected, <eol> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images and <eob> talks to # the patient. <eol>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eol> a very resource-intensive <eob> requiring xxxx # expert physicians, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, and is xxx considered <eob> practical <eol> for xxx developing

So, we this problem <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxx xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> xx # solve this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eol> x repeat, on xx order # <eob> of 10,000 of these <eob> very medical <eob> xx # generated.
After # xxxxx # then go <eol> # expert physician, <eol> would xxxx <eol> those images xxx xxx <eob>
And those two pieces of # <eol> information, <eol> x # can train xxxx <eol> neural network <eol> xx x xxxx <eol> learning <eol> network <eob> to <eol> provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis. <eol>
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eol> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence approaches <eol> xxxxxx from the <eob> same xxxxxxxx <eob>
Large of expert physicians <eob> xxx expert medical imaging # <eol>
So, # can we invent xxxx scalable, effective <eob> and <eol> # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important <eob> problems # facing <eob> us xxxxxx
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my <eob> # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented # a <eol> of AI # architectures to # solve some of the most important <eol> us today <eob> in xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials.
In xxxxxxx shared <eob> xxxx # you # had two goals. <eob>
xxx first <eob> goal # xx the # of <eob> to train artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we xxxxxx <eol> of # technologies <eob> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So how # xxx we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of xxxxxxxx <eob> with <eol> tens xxx thousands <eob> xx <eol> these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx # traditional AI, <eol> we started # with # single medical image. <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way <eol> xx # extract # billions <eol> of information
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease on the
In a <eob> sense, # we converted # one <eol> xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, <eol> massively reducing xxx amount of needed # for training. <eol>
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eol> we started with a # standard, <eol> xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera xx a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx
Then xxxxxxxx <eob> billions of information xxxxxxxx
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something we a # composite image. <eol>
to our surprise, <eob> # <eob> 50 -- <eol> I xxxxxxx # -- <eol> xx xxxxx # composite to <eob> to xxxx efficiencies.
To # <eol> summarize our approach, <eob> instead <eob> of 10,000 <eol> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train the AI algorithms <eob> in xx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> way, <eob> using only 50 of <eob> # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> acquired from # cameras and mobile and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, our <eob> algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the and even <eob> some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx the <eob> patient, <eob> instead of <eol> expensive <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era xxxxx # intelligence <eol> is going xx make # incredible on our <eob> xxxxxxx <eol>

xx when <eob> I place that # material, <eol> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave. <eol>
Now, # just like # xxx # <eol> weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # and # <eob> entire # <eob> xx show # on Netflix, the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a <eol> scaffold affects the way <eol> that <eob> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop.

What I find # remarkable is xxxx # # birds would not be able xx # do that <eob> if <eob> xxxx # all would have <eob> xx follow <eol> one leader. <eob>
Their # xxxxx <eol> would simply # be too low.
Instead, # scientists believe <eol> that these birds xxx aligned xx <eol> few simple rules, <eob> allowing # every <eob> # xxxxxx # bird <eol> # make decisions <eob> while flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
xxxxx alignment enables # their xxxxxxxxx and their autonomy <eol> makes # fast flexible. <eob>
what # does # this xxxx xx # do # any of us?
xxxxx it's <eob> # # way illustrating xxxxxxx to xx the most change <eob> that is # # of working <eol> today.
The world is getting faster more complex, <eob> so # <eob> we need a xxx # way working, <eol> way that alignment around <eol> that takes xxx bureaucracy <eob> and <eob> that truly xxxxxxxx people <eob> xx make <eob> # <eol> decisions xxxxxxx <eol>
But the # is: In order to get there, <eol> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, # I was working a bank that to embark <eol> on a transformation. <eol>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, more intuitive, xxxx relevant.
Now, I'm # not sure how many of you <eol> have # # from # the # inside, <eob> so let me # try # to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eol>
# of # people xx xxxxx <eob> xxxxxx elevators go <eol> xx # their department, <eol> # marketers, <eol> engineers xxxx engineers, # <eob>
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
Great xxxx end up <eol> in # PowerPoint # parking lots. <eob>
And there are between departments. <eob>
Getting done forever.
xx this xxxx knew <eob> xxxx in # xxxxx to they would have # to <eob> improve <eob> their time to xxxxxx <eol> by <eol> drastically changing <eob> working <eob> xx <eol>
But how?
To get some # <eob> inspiration, we <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> to <eob> xx and have # a look at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, <eob> like xxxxxxx <eob> Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos.
I remember how we were walking <eob> halls at # xxx # of <eol> in 2014, <eob> a # management <eol> and a of bankers. <eol>
We felt <eob> # strangers in # land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx smart, # employees. <eol>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" And <eol> # we expected to xxx an org <eob> xxxxxx
But xxxxxxxx # <eob> they <eob> used strange <eol> xxxx # names like xxxxxxxx <eob> and and "tribes" <eob> to # explain # how they xxxx organized. <eob>
So then <eob> we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # <eol> "How many are working <eob> xxx you?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
xxxx you report to?" "It <eol>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends".
Now, # over the <eob> course that <eob> xx gained a # better understanding xx xxxxx <eol> model. <eol>
They believed the # <eob> of small, autonomous <eob> teams. <eol>
xxxxx teams like <eol>
xxxx xxxxxxx and IT engineers in the team <eol> so they could <eol> design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers <eob> independently of others <eob> the company. <eob>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx
had all skills needed <eol> there xx the team. <eob>
Now, xx end of xxxx day, we # xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxxx on what xx <eob> had learned. <eob>
And # we xxx # started to # like xxxxx model, <eol> so # we # already # of <eob> how <eol> to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not <eob> # xxxx a word all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx "So I <eol> see # you xxxx xxx model.
But I have for you: What are you <eol> willing to # give xxxx What were we willing <eol> xx <eob> give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not <eol> # only xxxxx <eob> embracing # the new; <eob> xxxx xxxxx giving xx <eol> on some the <eol> old as xxxxx
Now, xxxx xxx # xxxx # five <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx <eob> to change their ways # of # xxxxxxxx
xxxxx <eol> has # xxxxx # skeptics about # # xxxx xx not <eol> going to work # for them. <eob>
"Our product is # more <eol> complex," <eob> xx # "They xxxxx # <eol> have the legacy IT like # xx # xxxx <eob> # just won't # allow this <eol> in our industry".
xxx xxx bank and also xxx xxx other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, was <eob> possible.
Within a # year, <eob> we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eol> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, channels xxx IT. <eol>
xxxxx thousand <eol> employees xxxx reorganized into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of # <eol> sitting with # people <eob> and # engineers engineers, <eol> a product xxxxxx <eob> xxx an engineer <eob> were now members of the same # xxxxx <eol>
You could be a member of <eol> # a xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx <eob> or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, <eol> etc. <eob>
At xxx # <eol> date <eol> of that organization, <eol> people # xxxx # shaking <eob> # hands <eol> for the # # xxxxx <eob> time, <eob> only to xxxx out xxxx they <eol> xxx <eol> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other but # # were each # other emails <eol> and # status reports for the last 10 #

# xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eob> together every <eob>
If product an # <eob> idea, <eob> xx can raise xx <eob> get <eob> # xxxxx from <eob> the # engineer <eol> who # is sitting right next to xxxx
They can xxxxxx to # with customers immediately # <eob> no handovers, xx # PowerPoints, # no red just # <eob> getting xxxxx done. <eob>
Now, getting there # is # xxx easy.
xxx turns # out, <eob> "What xxx you # willing to <eol> # <eob> give xxxx <eob> is exactly <eob> # xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx decision-making requires <eob> multidisciplinary # teams. <eol>
Instead xx # decisions going up and xxxx the organization, <eob> want the team to # decide. <eob>
But # to do so, we need <eob> all # the # skills <eol> and <eol> # expertise for # <eob> that decision <eob> in # team. <eob>
xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we physically co-locate # our xxxxxx <eol> who # are in # different different cities or <eol> even # countries today?
Or # should we <eol> in # better xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # do we consistency in # way xx do across these teams?
xx # need xxxx kind <eob> matrix. <eob>
Now, # all changes to structure <eol> and process and # procedure -- they are # <eob>
But # xxx <eob> I # xxxxx that xxx xxxx <eol> difficult # xxxxx # to change <eol> xx our xxx behavior. <eol>
Let me xxx xx # illustrate. <eol>
If we # want these # teams to be fast, <eob> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eol>
# this means xx # cannot leaders <eob> commanding their people <eol> what # to xxx when # <eob> xx do, how to xxx <eol>
No micromanagers.
# <eob> it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eol>
It's <eob> about # <eob> all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eol> xx take <eob>
obviously, <eob> xx also <eol> xx have all # these <eob> teams <eol> # in different directions, xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos.
So we need alignment and autonomy <eob> at the # xxxx xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eob>
an xxxxxxxxxxxxxx setting, <eol> xxxx requires # behaviors, <eol> xxx xxxx each new xxxxxxxxx <eob> there xx giving up <eob> on something xxx as well. <eob>
Leaders have # make sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the <eol> is aligned <eol> xxxxxxx # # -- the xxx -- <eob> the xxxxxxxxxx # the what.
But then # they have to xxx # xx <eol> and trust their <eol> xx # make xxxxx <eol> decisions on <eob> xxx xx # get # there.
xxxx creating xxxxxxxxx xxxx # and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx you know how # <eob> information x xxxxxx of # power? <eob>
Well, # <eob> some managers, <eob> may feel xx if they're giving up xxxx <eol> source <eob> xx power. <eol>
# xxxx not xxxx # managers. <eob>
The teams need # xx communicate openly and # as # well. <eol>
xx <eol> # these xxxxxxxxxx the <eol> xxxxxxxxx in # short sprints, <eob> and # at # xxx <eol> # xxx # sprint, <eol> organize a demo <eob> # xxxxxxx <eol> to share the output <eol> of what # done, <eob>
And every day, <eob> # member # of xxx team gives an update <eob> of xxxx they are <eob> working individually. <eob>
Now, all <eob> # <eob> transparency <eob> uncomfortable xxx people, because suddenly, # there is <eob> place to <eol> hide anymore. <eob>
Everything do <eol> for # xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, alignment xxx easy, <eol> and xxxxxxxxx # autonomy <eob> is so obvious, either. <eol>

And xxxxxxx of telling people to <eob> do, <eob> he looks ways to help # them. <eol>
That is radical <eob> for # someone be <eob> a xxxxxx # <eol> xx milestone-tracking. <eob>
But # <eol> xx the # world, said, <eob> xx only <eob> had the illusion of <eob>
In reality, # xxxx # xxxxxxxx would run xxxx time and over xxxxxxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
Now I <eob> have xxxx transparency, <eob> xxx I can xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> much earlier <eob> xx needed". <eob>
xxx middle <eol> to change as well. <eob>
First # all, without xxx handovers <eob> xxx # the <eob> xxxx of x <eol> need for managers. <eob>
And in the # old xxxxx # <eob> was # # of thinkers and doers. <eol>
Employees # would just xxxxxx # orders. <eob>
But xxxx instead of <eol> other people, middle managers were expected <eol> to # player-coaches.
xx imagine, for the last xx # years, have # just been # <eob> telling <eol> other people # to do, <eol> now you're expected xx do things xxxxxxxx again.
# xxxx model is not # for everyone, <eol> some xxxxxx # leave the # xxxxxxxx <eol>
# # is new # <eob> less hierarchy. <eol>
And all of this xx # work. <eob>
But # worth it.
The <eob> companies that I # with, <eol> they were used # <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob> new product features # a few per # year. <eob>
they # have # releases every # few # weeks, and without <eob> the <eob> # handovers <eol> and the # xxx # tape, <eob> the # whole organization <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
finally, if you xxx # halls <eob> # companies today, <eob> xxx just <eol> feel # a xxx energy.
feels xx if xxxxxx # walking the <eob> halls of # x very start-up. <eol>
xxxx to be fair, these companies, <eob> they cannot # claim victory

xxx # xxxxx # getting <eob> faster <eob> and more xxxxxxxx <eol> so we need to reboot xxx way of # working. <eob>
And xxx xxxxxxx part # of that change is xxx # xx structure process # or # procedure, <eob> and it's also # not just <eob> xxxxxx executives xxxxxx
xxxxxxx will be xxx xx those in xxx # <eob> who embrace the <eob>
