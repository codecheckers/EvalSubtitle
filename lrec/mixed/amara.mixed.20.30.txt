Imagine waking up a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you online, waking up to # an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome # to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women <eob> face xx Pakistan is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes deadly <eob>
This xxxx of harassment keeps women <eol> from accessing xxx internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is xxx sixth most populous <eol> country the world, <eob> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access <eol> to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down <eob> with xxx rise new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is # also the birthplace <eol> of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan.
xxxxxxx aspect is # where the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked # to women and # their bodies; <eob> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> even kill them sometimes <eob> the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where xxxxx # are left # to die <eol> right outside their houses <eob> for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's # xxx honor; <eob> it's a <eob> cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a small village <eol> in # Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eob> to pursue their higher <eob> education. <eob>
The # elders of # my family <eol> allow women <eob> to pursue # their higher education <eol> or xxxxx careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father # was # one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of <eob>
But in xxx end, I knew <eol> it's either me xx them, <eob> chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and for a woman wouldn't allow me to own x mobile <eol> until x was married. <eob>
And even I was married, <eob> this tool # became a tool for my xxx surveillance. <eob>
xxxx I resisted this idea <eol> of surveilled my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve # of this <eob> and threw me # out of # his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was # the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
are women not # allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
While the law states x xxxxx <eol> has # the same equal <eob> to the # information, <eob> why is it always men -- # brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So to take # a step, instead of # keep questioning these patriarchal <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to the issues and # women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eob>
lobbying xxx free and safe internet <eob> xx convincing young women <eob> that to the safe xxxxxxxx <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my part <eol> in igniting # the spark <eob> to address # the questions <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a xxxx <eob> in my heart, <eob> and to offer <eob> a solution to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December xxxx -- <eob> (Applause)
to extend my support to # the women <eol> who do xxx know <eob> who to turn to when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online.
I think of the women # who do not # have <eob> the necessary support to # deal with <eob> the mental trauma <eol> when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go <eob> about daily <eob> xxxxxxxx that is <eol> x rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the <eol> is an to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eol>
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting # for equality. <eob>
you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
at # critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # failing
Why? <eob>
In <eob> # some cases, # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this # is unacceptable.
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
xxx are we # xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the right course? <eob>
It's <eob> not going to be easy. <eob>
For I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've # chosen the right objectives <eol> and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eob> others of # them have <eob>
And today # # to share with xxx <eob> what # really makes x xxxxxxxxxx -- that's what's crucial, <eob> how xxx why <eob> they set meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right <eob> reasons. <eol>
Let's go <eol> back to # 1975. <eob>
Yep, this # # me. <eob>
I've <eob> got a xxx to learn, <eob> I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long # hair, <eob> but # I'm # working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the # greatest manager <eol> of his or any # other era.
Andy was # a superb <eol> and also a <eol> teacher, <eob> and he said # to me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy # a system <eol> called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # kind of rolls off <eol> xxx tongue, doesn't it?
xxx it's all about excellent <eob>
So a classic <eol> video from the 1970s <eob> of Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eol> management by objective systems <eob> are the # objectives and the <eol> key results, <eob> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx
xxx key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can # look <eol> and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I <eob> not that?" No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a # simple goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and they # work for organizations, they work teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eob>
are what <eol> want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how <eol> I'm going xx get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: xxxx of us are goals wrong, <eob> and most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx <eob> make their numbers, <eob> but they lack a sense of <eob> purpose <eol> to xxxxxxx their teams. <eob>
So # xxx do you set <eol> these goals the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, must answer the # "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their # passion and to their # purpose, <eob> they develop a clear <eol> and compelling # sense of why. <eob>
x want to tell you # a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs <eol> of lots of workers # at large companies.
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, <eob> the government issued a proposal <eol> to build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll # <eol> that Medicaid is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, our # xxxxx our children <eob> and people with disabilities. <eol>
Nuna the <eob> time was # <eob> just 15 people and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, <eob> and # they had a set of commitments <eol> xxxx they xxx to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money xx the project. <eob>
xxxx xxx a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism.
And he was seven, <eob> he had his # xxxxx grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eol>
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants. <eob>
They came # to the # country <eol> xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eol> so it was up to Jini to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine # years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eol> xxx that company bid on, won and delivered on that xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxx Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from bankruptcy, <eol> and # today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for millions others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of xxxx # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> with dignity. <eol>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, what <eob> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> are inspiring, <eob> and they're kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think # a rockstar <eol> would be unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eob> to wage a global xxx <eol> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The # is xxxx relief <eob> for the poorest <eol> xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eob>
The next xxxxxxxxx access <eol> anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good <eob>
xxxxx xx back to # our checklist. <eol>
Check. # Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's <eob> just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does # your passion <eol> lead xxx to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a rhyme # with the # head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
# OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx <eob>
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> xx structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eol> magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> and magic is <eob> right around the # corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, <eob> xxxx Bono the # whats # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn # attention the xxxxx <eol>
Remember, the hows the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx
They're measurable, <eol> and they're <eol> verifiable. <eob>
Those are good <eob> key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eol> Larry # and Sergey.
Here they <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite.
What he really # said was, <eob> "We any other to manage this company, <eob> so it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And # I # took xxxx as x <eol> kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written down <eol> her objectives and her key <eol>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've xxxxxxxxx # them <eol> for everyone to <eol>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the xxxx generation client platform <eob> for the future <eol> of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- in other words, build xxx browser. <eol>
He was very xxxxxxxxxx <eol> about how # he chose his key results.
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not. <eob>
So he this # one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eol> build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the ante. <eob>
In first year, <eol> his # was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He less xxxx 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eob> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
xxxxxxxx better. <eob>
In the # third year, <eob> he upped the <eol> ante once xxxx <eol> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved xxx technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 # <eob> million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this # story, <eob> xxx so much for the happy <eob> but it someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's x perfect story for nerd me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
really matters is # the xxx <eol> that xx <eob> pour xxxx those vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work. <eol>
are x silver # bullet. <eob>
They're not going to # <eol> a substitute a strong culture <eob> or for leadership, <eob> but # when those # fundamentals are # in place, <eol> they # can take you to the mountaintop.
I # want you # to # think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write # down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results.
xx it today. <eob>
If # like some feedback <eol> on them, <eol> you # can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eol> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx <eob> affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for # everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access to xxx the world's information.
Here's the <eol> deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered xxxxx by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've been called <eol> the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading <eol> good gospel <eol> according # to Andy xxxxxx <eob> but I want you <eol> to join xx # in this # movement. <eob>
Let's fight what it is <eol> xxxx really # matters, <eol> because we can # take OKRs <eol> beyond our <eob> businesses. <eol>
# can take them to our families, <eol> to our schools, <eol> even to # our governments. <eob>
We can xxxx those # governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track <eob> if we can and do measure what really matters. <eob>
Thank <eob>

What is history? <eob>
It is something written <eob> by the winners.
is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eob> in countries, like mine, Russia, <eol> look at as something <eol> that was <eob> or determined xx leaders, <eob> and common people could xxx influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eob> or ever will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to <eob> the way <eob> history has xxxx <eob> framed to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two # <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to <eol> the year 1917, <eob> the year xx the Russian Revolution.
x asked myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we built <eol> a # social network xxx dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 <eob> # years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website # xx application <eob> follow a feed <eol> xxx each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eol> like # xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, <eol> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eob> being ordinary people like # you xxx me, <eob> not # demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eol> of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, weaknesses, not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxx project was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx <eob> who used to think that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eol> xxx xxx our destiny. <eob>
But we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and <eob> white. <eol>
1917 # led <eob> to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx this # project, we see # that Russia <eol> could # have had a different history <eob> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as # any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eob> you learn that xxxxxx <eol> was first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing # <eob> history and understanding <eol> xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eob> can help # us create a future, because history is xxxx a rehearsal <eol> of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, and this xxxxx for example, <eob> we started a # xxx online project <eol> that called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary that gives you an impression <eol> of that xxxxx <eol> a year marked by global social change that, many ways, <eol> xxxxxxx the world as know it now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all # the main <eol> could use mobile phones # ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that x lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and <eol> were fighting the same values, <eob> no <eob> matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history in such a democratic way, <eob> through # social media, <eob> we show that people xx power <eol> are not the only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eol>
That gives # any user a <eol> possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
people matter.
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eob>
We shape <eob>
We all make history. <eol>
you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eob>
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eob> is often referred to xx AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eol> on our lives in the # future. <eob>
Today, # however, <eol> we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several # life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious diseases xxx cancer.
xxxxxxxxx of every lose their # lives <eol> due to liver and # oral cancer. <eob>
Our xxxx way xx help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases. <eob>
So how xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert physician xxxxx <eob> # orders <eol> very expensive <eol> medical xxxxxxx technologies <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are # collected, another # expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the patient. <eob>
As you can see, this is <eol> a very process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is <eob> considered practical <eob> for the # developing world. <eob>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can # <eol> we this <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to <eob> use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> these very expensive medical # <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then # <eol> # an # expert physician, <eol> who would then analyze <eol> those images for <eob>
And # using those two pieces xx information, <eol> I can train a standard deep neural network <eol> xx deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's # diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, <eob> traditional # <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> xxx # expert <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eol>
So, can we invent more scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very <eol> problems facing today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group <eol> at MIT Media xxx does. <eob>
We have invented # a variety <eol> of unorthodox # AI architectures <eob> to solve some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical # trials. <eob>
In # the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two <eob> goals. <eol>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> xxx number <eob> of images <eob> required to train artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how we # do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and thousands <eob> of these very # expensive images, <eol> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started a single medical image. <eol>
From this # image, <eol> my team and x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information # packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering xx the disease <eol> xx the medical image. <eob>
In x sense, we converted # one <eol> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the # amount of data <eol> needed xxx training. <eob>
For our second xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the use expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired either <eob> from x DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those billions of information # packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from <eol> xxx medical image onto this <eob> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image. <eob>
Much to our <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, # xxxx # 50 # -- <eob> of composite images to train <eol> xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize xxx approach, <eob> instead of using <eol> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the AI <eol> in an # unorthodox way, <eol> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> xxx xxxxxx phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can # accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, <eol> some <eol> # very simple, # white light <eol> photographs from patient, <eob> of # expensive <eol> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I believe that we are # poised <eol> to enter an # <eob> where artificial # intelligence <eob> is to make an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> impact # on our xxxxxxx <eob>
I think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue # thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept # small xxxxxxx # of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx <eob> especially in xxxxxx # care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine <eol> and, like getting # over a cold, <eob> you could your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, xx we have an operation or # xx accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx give <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
like vaccines <eol> instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eol> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues and quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several # organisms <eol> that <eob> can achieve this feat.
Some lizards can <eob> regrow their tails, the humble salamander <eob> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and # even us mere <eol> can # regrow our liver <eob> after <eob> losing more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make xxxx magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can <eob> wounds # and build # tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eob> xxx immune system defends <eol> our # body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to key players <eob> in our fight to build <eob> back <eol> xxx cuts and bruises. <eob>
xxxx looking at materials <eol> that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating an injured xxxx these <eob> materials, <eob> xxxxx <eob> was a large number of immune xxxxx <eob> in xxxx material <eol> and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
xx in <eob> this case, <eob> instead <eob> of xxx immune <eob> cells # rushing off <eol> towards infection fight bacteria, <eol> they're rushing toward # an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of xxxxxx cell, <eob> the helper T cell, <eob> was present inside <eol> material that I implanted xxx absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were x kid <eol> and # you'd break your pencil <eob> try # and <eob> tape it back together again, <eob> can # heal, <eob> but # it might not be <eol> # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll xxx a scar. <eob>
So if # we xxxxx have <eol> these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat # <eob> cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx as # strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back without these scars <eob> and look <eol> like # what it was <eol> before we were even injured.
I'm working to create materials <eol> that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> xx changing the immune <eol>
We know that any time <eol> a material # implanted in our # body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eob>
This ranges xxxx pacemakers <eol> to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials # that engineers are using <eol> xx try and new
xx when # I xxxxx that material, <eol> or # scaffold, in body, <eob> the immune creates <eol> small environment cells and proteins <eob> that change the xxx <eol> that our stem cells behave.
just like the # weather <eol> affects our # daily activities, <eob> like # going for a run <eob> or staying and <eol> entire TV show # Netflix, <eol> immune of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop.
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the signals, we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eol>
These scaffolds # are of a different things, <eob> plastics to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> sponges that are or less porous, <eol> gels of stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals time. <eob>
xx other # words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them <eob> the correct <eob> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be <eol> changed # different <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of signals <eob> that mimic # how our <eol> body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In # the future, # we see <eol> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we aren't going to xxxx up tomorrow <eol> and be able xx heal # like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But <eob> # xxxx these advances, <eob> and # working with our immune system <eol> to build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able xx keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

as a child, <eob> I used spend all of <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, humid, days, <eol> x would dash xxxxxx # floor <eol> xxx stick my face in # front of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eol>
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eol> though # <eob> was a privileged one in # our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me. <eob>
During # the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eob> xx bypass the meter after <eol> their heat shut off, <eob> xxxx to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day. <eob>
xxxxx of dangerous <eol> incidents xxx take root when people # are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on # energy.
In # contrast, # low-income <eol> and <eol> xxxxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # spend 20, 30 percent <eol> of <eob> their income on energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide # power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are xx much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # you take child <eob> get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high # energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, <eol> and even schoolteachers who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx million people a year <eol> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for <eob> their most needs.
As a result, those xxxx <eol> xxxx energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eob> like disease and asthma. <eol>
Look -- # given rockets to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized # <eob> we have the xxxxx to address <eol> these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is <eob>
Cost xx renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
even as we approach cost xxxxxxx <eob> the majority <eob> of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn <eob> much more than the average American.
This is why, # when I was 22, I # the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by # with # communities, <eob> utilities and # government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe the power of local # communities, <eol> in <eol> the transforming effect <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eob> xxxx have <eob> the highest energy burdens.
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eob> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eol> and making even small <eol> updates to their homes like better insulation windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting # <eob> xx community solar <eob> and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx smart home research <eob> and installation # programs <eob> to help families <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're even working # xxxxxxxx <eol> with xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eob> we xxxx to # work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, xxx # US spends over three billion <eob> a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do help millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only able to help <eol> fraction of # those in need. <eob>
In there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not <eob>
But by building energy equity <eob> and # resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eol> to that is clean, <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At scale, # microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and efficiency <eol> dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eob>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 # their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a # person's income <eol> who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eob>
This is # life-changing. <eob>
This is an opportunity <eob> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eob> to xxxxxxx their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eol> and xxx neighbors, <eob> the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # to make <eob> and xxx # effect # <eol> our whole xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this # <eob> is not just about # them. <eob>
There # are xxxxxxxx nationwide having to make the same # <eob> impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eol> xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eob> but # through relationships <eol> with communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will # all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>

Have ever <eob> a flock of birds work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating? <eol>
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they # all would have to follow one leader. <eol>
Their reaction <eob> # speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned on x few simple rules, <eob> allowing <eob> every single bird to make autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect <eob> synchrony. <eol>
alignment enables their autonomy, and their autonomy <eol> xxxxx them xxxx and flexible. <eob>
xxxx what does this have to do <eol> with any one of # us? <eob>
Well, it's one <eol> # of xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eol> that is needed in ways of working # today. <eol>
The world getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so # we need a new way <eob> of # xxxxxxxx <eob> a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give xxx <eob>
few years ago, # I was working with a <eob> wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They # wanted # xxxxx offering to be simpler, <eol> intuitive, xxxx relevant.
Now, I'm not sure how many you have seen a bank from <eob> the # inside, <eob> so # let me try to illustrate <eol> xxxx many traditional <eob> banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits taking elevators to go <eol> to their # department, <eob> marketers # sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with xx people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
anything # done xxx take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to # transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eol> # to market <eob> by drastically xxxxxxxx <eol> their ways xx as well. <eob>
xxx how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> to # go and have a look at # companies <eol> # seem to be more innovative, <eob> xxxx <eob> Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I <eob> remember # how we xxxx walking <eol> the xxxxx at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> x management consultant <eol> and a xxxx of # bankers. <eob>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots # of # xxxxxx creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eob> we expected xx # get an org chart.
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> funny names like # "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> # explain they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to xxxxxxxxx <eol> that to our # own world. <eob>
We asked, "How people <eol> are working for you?" "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides your priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were <eob> # asking # for what we thought <eol> were some # of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and their answer xxxx "It depends". <eob>
Now, over the course of that xxxx <eob> xx gained a better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their model. <eob>
They believed in # power <eol> of small, teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eol>
xxxx had product people <eob> and # IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of # others in the # company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had all the skills needed right there # in the team. <eob>
Now, at # the <eob> end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eol> to reflect xx what we had learned.
And <eob> xx had started to like their model, <eob> xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas <eol> to a # bank. <eob>
But xxxxx # one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see like our # model. <eob>
But # I have one question for you: <eol> What # are willing to give up?" <eob> What were <eob> we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have xx answer immediately, but we knew he was right. <eob>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> on some # of the old as # <eob>
Now, over the past five years, <eol> I # have # worked with companies all over the world <eob> to change their xxxx # of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own skeptics about why this not <eol> going work # xxx them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eol> xx "They # have <eob> the # legacy IT like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators # just won't this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank <eob> and also for the other companies <eob> that I worked with afterwards, change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we # completely <eol> blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> xxxxxxxx channels and <eol> IT. <eob>
Three # employees xxxx # <eol> into # 350 teams. <eol>
So <eob> instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with product # people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a # product # person and an <eob> engineer <eol> were now members of the same <eob>
You could be a member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening or the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the <eol> go-live date <eol> that # new organization, <eol> some people xxxxxxx hands <eol> for the very first time, <eob> to # find out that they # had been <eol> sitting two # away from each other <eob> but they xxxx sending each # other emails <eob> and status reports for the last 10 # years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy # that # I <eol> was always chasing xxx answers". <eob> <eob>
But they're <eob> every day.
xx the product <eob> guy xxx an idea, <eol> xx can just raise <eob> to get input the engineer xxx sitting right next # to # him.
They can to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red xxxxx <eob> xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eob>
Now, getting there is # not # easy. <eol>
xxx # as it turns out, <eob> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the # right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
of decisions <eol> up and down the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to xx so, we need all the # <eol> and expertise for that # decision <eob> in the team. <eol>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> are working in different <eob> buildings, <eol> different cities or <eol> different countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing?
And how do <eol> we ensure consistency in the way # we do things <eob> across these
We still some kind <eol> of management
Now, all these changes structure <eol> process and procedure -- <eob> xxxx # are not <eob>
in the end, <eob> I found that the # most difficult thing to change <eol> xx our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me # try to illustrate.
we # want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and <eob> autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when # to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that each <eol> xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # title. <eol>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now # obviously, we also # cannot afford <eob> to have # all teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> xxxxxxx that would certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eob> just a flock of <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new behavior, <eob> there # is giving up <eol> on something old <eob> as well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure <eob> xxxx # everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall -- # the why -- overall priorities -- the what. <eol>
then they have to let # go <eol> and trust # their # teams <eob> to make the right decisions <eol> on how to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you how they say <eol> that information # is a source of power?
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing <eob> information may # feel as <eol> they're giving up that <eol> source of power. <eob>
it's <eob> not just <eob> managers.
xxx teams need to communicate openly and transparently well. <eob>
In these <eob> xxxxxxxxxx xxx teams <eol> typically work # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session share the output <eol> what they've transparently. <eob>
And every <eob> each # <eob> member of the gives # an update <eob> of what they are # working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can xx uncomfortable people, <eob> because there xx no place to # hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone. <eob>
So, # is not easy, <eob> providing autonomy <eob> not xx obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain xxx he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, # today, to know how things # are # going, <eob> instead of looking at reports, <eob> he needs to walk down the team floors <eol> to attend one of their <eob> sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is xxxxxxx change <eob> for someone <eol> who used to xx <eob> a master of <eob>
But in the xxx world, this executive # said, <eob> "I only had the illusion xx control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would over time and xxxx budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have xxxx more <eob> and # I can <eob> course-correct much if needed". <eob>
And middle <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First <eol> xx <eol> all, without the handovers <eol> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the world, there was <eol> idea of thinkers # and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow <eol> orders. <eob>
But now, instead of # only <eol> xxxxx people, <eob> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the 10 <eob> you have # just been telling <eob> xxxxxx what to do, <eob> but now # you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some <eob> great leave the xxxxxxxx
But the result is # a new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy.
And xxx this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth <eob>
The that I worked # with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product a few times per year. <eob>
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eob> and the red tape, <eob> the whole # organization <eob> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And if walk the halls <eol> xx these companies today, <eob> you just <eob> a # energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eob> more xxxxxxxx <eol> so we <eob> need reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest of that <eol> is not in structure <eob> or xxxxxxx or procedure, <eob> and it's also <eol> not just <eob> senior # executives xxxxxx charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of in the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eol>
xx all # have xx lead <eol> change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are willing <eob> to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

We're coming up on xxxx 800 xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and # live <eob> from # xxxxxxxxxx Alabama, Mississippi, <eol> to where I xxxxxx
They're also in 67 countries. <eob>
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eob>
Some of them not even <eol> to have a home base, they're xxxxxxx <eob>
they are in RVs <eol> or traveling xxxxxxx Airbnbs, <eob> xxxx are xx new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
As xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally.
It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> from the very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't the word "remote," because it sets up the expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is on # an playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed # workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> xx build a # company. <eob>
The xxx is you have to <eol> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many the # first 20 hires <eol> were xxxxxx I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eol>
In Silicon Valley, the tech # companies fish from essentially <eol> the same small pond or # bay. <eob>
x distributed xxxxxxx <eol> can fish from xxx entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone # grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in <eob> you can gain someone who xxxxxx <eol> works, <eob> wakes up and # goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> xxxx bring a different <eol> understanding of <eol> culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of <eol> to go distributed, <eob> xxxxxxx a desire to give <eol> people autonomy <eol> over xxx they # do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a role <eob> where hours are important, <eob> you # can # your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have corner office, <eol> their windows, the # food they want to eat, you <eob> can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You xxx what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eol>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # workforce <eol> xx xxxxx for x technology company. <eob>
But people often me, <eob> works <eol> great for xxxxxx <eol> but <eob> what about everyone else?" <eob> If you # have an office, you do a <eol> things <eob> to build xxxxxxxxxxx capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in # moment, <eob> in # the kitchen, # the <eob>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team <eol> are having conversations <eob> don't have <eol> xxxxxxx see these decisions made <eol> without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail where you were <eol> and what # you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to # pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows in # <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eob> people and xxxxxx <eol>
Try to have <eob> # much # communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> xx # allows # new people to catch up <eob>
You also need to find the tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day <eob> video <eol> conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how <eob> you <eol> probably # aren't objects anymore. <eob>
xxxxxx you access <eol> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment xxxx different <eol> tools that enable <eob> see what xxxxxx <eob>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In a traditional office, you're in the same place <eol> weeks out of xxx year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks <eob>
We <eol> xxx to that: we come # together <eob> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eob> comes together a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eob> We <eol> # want to make # sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on same page, <eob> and they have a deeper <eol> with their colleagues.
When they xxxx together <eob> the rest of the year, <eol> they can bring xxxxxxxx <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And <eol> # the final practice: <eob> give people the to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> xxxx they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy coffee, so don't <eol> get kicked out # of the coffee shop. <eob>
One <eob> group in Seattle <eol> decided pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a workspace on a pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is # money they can invest <eol> xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so can have the most productive environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict # that # <eol> 90 # percent of companies that are going to be <eob> the course of the # world <eob> are going to function this <eol>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be <eob> replaced by those that are.
As you think xxxxx <eol> xxxx you're going to build next, <eol> consider how you can tap <eol> into global xxxxxxx <eob> give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eol> xxxxx # they feel they xxxxxx <eob> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eol> it <eol> is that you're creating <eob> together. <eob>
