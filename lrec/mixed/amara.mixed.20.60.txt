Imagine waking up a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers <eob> questioning your right to existence <eol> for something that you online, waking up to # an angry message, scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome # to the world of cyberharassment. <eol>
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women <eob> face xx Pakistan is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes <eol> deadly <eob>
This xxxx of harassment <eol> keeps women <eol> from accessing xxx internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eol>
is xxx sixth most populous country the world, <eol> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access to technologies, and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down <eol> with xxx rise new technologies. <eol>
Pakistan is # also the birthplace of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, Malala Yousafzai. <eol>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect is # where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is <eol> linked # to women and # their bodies; <eob> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> even kill them sometimes <eol> the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where xxxxx # are left # to die <eol> right outside their <eob> houses <eob> for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol>
Let me say this very clearly: <eol> it's # xxx honor; <eol> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a small village <eob> in # Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher <eob> education. <eob>
The # elders of # my family allow women <eob> to pursue # their higher education or xxxxx careers.
However, unlike the other <eob> male guardians of my family, <eol> my father # was # one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eol>
To get my <eob> law degree, of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of <eol>
But in xxx end, I knew <eob> it's either me xx them, <eob> chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and for a woman wouldn't <eob> allow me to <eob> own x mobile <eol> until x was married. <eob>
And even I was married, <eob> this tool # became a tool for <eol> my xxx surveillance. <eob>
xxxx I <eob> resisted this idea <eob> of <eob> surveilled my ex-husband, he really didn't approve # of this <eob> and threw me # out of # his house, <eol> along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was # the time when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
are women not # allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
While the law states x xxxxx has # the <eob> same equal to the # information, <eol> why is it always men -- # <eol> brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively <eol> making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So to take # a step, <eob> instead of # keep <eob> questioning <eol> these <eol> patriarchal and societal norms.
And I the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 <eob> to the issues <eol> and # women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eol>

With a xxxx in my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution <eob> to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's <eol> and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December xxxx -- (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to # the women <eol> who do <eob> xxx know who to <eob> turn to <eol> when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online.
I think of the women # <eob> who do not # have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to # deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they <eol> go about <eob> daily <eol> xxxxxxxx that is x rape threat in their in-box. <eob>

Our leaders, <eob> of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx # failing <eob>
Why?
In # some cases, # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this # is unacceptable. <eob>
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct these <eob> wrongs? <eol>
xxx are we # xxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx the right course? <eob>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've # chosen the right objectives and xxx wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of # them have <eob>
And today # # to share with xxx <eol> what # really makes x <eol> xxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> that's what's crucial, <eob> how xxx why they set meaningful and <eol> audacious <eob> goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to # 1975. <eob>
Yep, this # # me. <eob>
I've got a xxx <eob> to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long # hair, but # I'm # working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called <eob> the # greatest manager <eol> of his or any # other era.
Andy was # a superb <eol> and also a teacher, <eob> and he said # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy # a system <eol> called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # kind of rolls off <eol> xxx tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxx it's all about excellent
So a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eol> management by objective systems <eob> are the # objectives and the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx key <eol> results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can <eol> # look <eob> and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I not that?" <eol> No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. <eob> No. Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eol> are a # simple <eob> goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and they # work for organizations, <eob> they work teams, they even work for individuals.
are what <eol> want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how <eol> I'm going xx <eob> get that done. <eol>
Objectives. Key results. <eol>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eob> xxxx of us are goals wrong, <eob> and most xx us <eol> are not setting goals <eob> at all. <eol>
A lot <eob> of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them.
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their <eob> numbers, <eol> but they lack a sense of purpose to xxxxxxx their teams. <eol>
So # xxx do you set these goals the xxxxx way?
First, must answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eol>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their # passion and to their # purpose, <eob> they <eob> develop a clear <eol> and compelling # sense of why.
x want to tell you # a story. <eol>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eol>
She runs <eol> a company called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, <eol> they xxxx data # to serve the <eol> health needs <eol> of lots <eob> of workers # at large companies. <eob>
And <eol> then two years <eol> into the company's life, the government issued a proposal <eob> to build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll # that Medicaid is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our # xxxxx our children <eob> and people with <eob> disabilities. <eob>
Nuna the time was # just 15 people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, <eol> and # they had a set of commitments <eol> xxxx they xxx to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money xx the project. <eob>
xxxx xxx a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. She did not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has <eob> autism. <eob>
And he was seven, <eob> he had <eob> his # xxxxx grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He <eol> fell to the ground. <eob> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants. <eob>
They came # to the # country <eol> xxxx limited resources <eol> speaking little English, so it was up to Jini <eob> to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine # years <eob> old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, and that mission became her company, <eol> xxx that <eol> company bid on, won <eol> and delivered <eob> on that xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxx Jini to <eob> tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy, <eob> and # today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for millions others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of xxxx <eol> # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eob> with dignity. <eol>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eol> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, what <eol> we want to <eol> have <eob> accomplished.
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob> are inspiring, <eob> and they're kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think # a <eob> rockstar would be unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key <eol> Results, <eob> but <eob> xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eob> to wage a global xxx <eol> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx and his ONE organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eob> audacious objectives. <eol>
The # is xxxx relief for the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # <eob> the world. <eob>
The <eol> next <eob> xxxxxxxxx access anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good <eob>
xxxxx xx back to # our checklist.
Check. # Concrete? <eol> Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So <eol> you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does # your passion <eob> lead xxx to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eob> a rhyme # with the <eob> # head, <eol> then your passion means <eob> nothing. <eob>
# OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx <eol>
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for risk, <eol> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable offense.
And when you have that sort <eol> xx structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eol> magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> and magic <eob> is right around the <eol> # corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, xxxx <eob> Bono the # whats # of # goal-setting.
Let's turn # attention the xxxxx
Remember, the hows the key <eob> results. <eol> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results are specific and time-bound. <eol>
They're aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results.
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, Larry # and Sergey. <eol>
Here they 24 years old in <eol> their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
What he really # said was, <eob> "We any other <eol> to manage this company, so it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written down <eol> her objectives and her key <eol>
They've graded them, and they've xxxxxxxxx # them <eol> for everyone to <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # set aside. <eob>
They're <eob> for a higher purpose, and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, <eob> a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an <eol> objective <eob> which was to build <eob> the xxxx generation client platform for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> in other words, build xxx browser. <eob>
He <eol> was very <eob> xxxxxxxxxx about how # he chose his key results.
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser? <eol>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eol> xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eol> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not. <eol>
So he <eob> this # one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser.
And then every <eol> year he stuck <eol> to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, <eob> but the ante.
In first year, <eol> his # was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He less xxxx 10.
Second year, he <eob> raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
xxxxxxxx better. <eob>
In the # third year, <eol> he upped the <eol> ante once xxxx <eob> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> marketing campaign, broader distribution, <eob> improved xxx technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 # million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this # story, <eob> xxx so much for the happy but it someone <eob> carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's x perfect story for nerd me.
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made from <eol> the whats <eol> and <eob> hows of our ambitions. <eob>
really matters is <eol> # the xxx <eol> that xx pour xxxx those vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
are x silver # bullet. <eol>
They're not going to # <eol> a substitute a strong culture <eol> or for <eob> leadership, <eob> but # when those # fundamentals are # in place, they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I # want you # to # think <eol> about your life for a moment.
Do you # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write # down your values, <eol> your objectives and your key results. <eol>
xx it today. <eob>
If <eob> # like some feedback on them, <eob> you # can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of xxxxx <eol> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx <eob> affordable health care, high-quality for # everyone, ending global poverty, <eob> access to xxx the world's <eob> information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eol> every one of those goals <eol> is powered xxxxx by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs for spreading good gospel <eol> according # to Andy xxxxxx <eob> but I want you <eol> to join xx # in this # movement. <eob>
Let's fight what it is <eob> xxxx really # matters, because we can # take <eob> OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
# can take them to our families, to our schools, <eob> even to # our governments.
We can xxxx those # governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform # those informations.
We can # get back on the right track <eob> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eol>
Thank <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What is <eol> history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in countries, like mine, Russia, <eol> look at as something <eol> that was <eob> or determined xx leaders, <eob> and common people could xxx influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eol> or ever will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to the way <eol> history has xxxx framed to the citizens <eol> of Russia. <eol>
And this is true. <eol>
To prove it, I spent two # <eob> of my life trying to <eob> go 100 years <eol> back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year xx the <eob> Russian Revolution. <eob>
x asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eol>
So last year, we built <eob> a # social network xxx dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 <eob> people <eob> 100 # years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website # xx application <eol> follow a feed <eol> xxx each day of 1917 and read what people <eol> like # xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eob> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like # you xxx me, <eob> not # demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eol> of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, <eob> weaknesses, <eol> not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxx <eol> project was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx who used to think that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eob> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy xxx xxx our destiny.
But we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and white. <eol>
1917 # led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx this # project, we see # that Russia <eol> could # have had a different history <eob> and a <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as # any other country could or <eol> still can. <eol>
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eob> you learn that xxxxxx <eob> was first country in the world to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or one the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights.
Knowing # history and understanding <eol> xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eob> can help # us create a future, <eob> because history is xxxx a rehearsal of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this xxxxx <eob> for example, we started a # xxx online project <eol> that called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary <eol> that gives you an impression <eol> of that xxxxx <eob> a year marked by global social change <eob> that, many ways, <eol> xxxxxxx the world as know it now. <eob>
But we <eob> are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all # the main could use mobile phones <eol> # ... <eob> just like that? <eol>
And we see that x <eob> lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eob> and were fighting the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or France <eob> or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eob> in such a democratic way, <eob> through # social media, <eob> we show that people xx power are not the <eob> only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives # any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
people matter. <eob>
They <eol> have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eol>
Journalists, scientists, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eol>
We shape <eol>
We all make history. <eob>
you. <eob>
(Applause)
algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at <eob> a massive scale, using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eob>
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> of # computers <eol> is often referred to <eob> xx AI <eol> or artificial # intelligence.
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eob> on our lives in the # future.
Today, # however, we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eob> several # life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as <eol> infectious diseases xxx cancer. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx of every <eob> lose their # lives <eob> due to liver and # oral cancer. <eol>
Our xxxx way xx help these patients <eob> is to perform early <eol> detection <eol> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases.
So how xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert physician xxxxx # orders very expensive <eol> medical xxxxxxx technologies <eol> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, CTs, MRIs, # to be performed.
Once those <eol> images are <eob> # collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and <eob> talks to the patient. <eol>
As you can see, this is a very process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, and is considered practical <eob> for the # <eob> developing world.
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, <eob> as well. <eob>
So, can # we this <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eob> these very expensive medical # <eol> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then # # an # expert physician, <eol> who would then analyze <eol> those images for <eob>
And # using those two pieces xx information, <eob> I can train a standard deep neural network <eol> xx deep learning network <eob> to provide <eol> patient's # diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, <eob> traditional # intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eob> xxx # expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we invent more scalable, # effective and xxxx xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very <eol> problems facing today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at MIT Media xxx does. <eob>
We have invented # a variety <eol> of <eol> unorthodox # AI architectures <eol> to solve some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today in medical imaging <eob> and clinical # trials.
In # the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal <eol> was to reduce <eob> xxx number of images required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more <eob> ambitious, xx wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how we # do it? <eol>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting tens <eol> and thousands <eob> of these very # expensive images, <eol> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started a single medical image. <eol>
From this # image, my team and <eob> x figured <eob> out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information # packets. <eol>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry and rendering xx the disease <eob> xx the medical image. <eob>
In x sense, we converted # <eob> one into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the <eob> # amount of data <eol> needed xxx training. <eob>
For our second xxxxx to xxxxxx the use expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired either from x DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile <eob> phone, for the patient. <eol>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information # packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from <eol> xxx medical image onto this <eob> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image. <eol>
Much to our <eob> we only required <eob> 50 -- <eob> I repeat, # xxxx # 50 # -- <eol> of composite images to train xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize xxx approach, <eob> instead of using <eob> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the <eol> AI <eol> in an # unorthodox way, <eol> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> xxx xxxxxx phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can # accept, in the future and even right now, <eob> some # very simple, # white <eob> light <eol> photographs from patient, <eob> of # expensive <eol> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx
I believe that we are # poised <eol> to enter an # <eol> where artificial # intelligence <eol> is to make an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> impact # on our xxxxxxx <eob>
I think that <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which data-rich but <eob> application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue # thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept # small xxxxxxx <eol> # of data <eol> and solve some of the most important <eob> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx <eob> especially in xxxxxx <eob> # care. <eob>
Thank you <eol> very much. <eob>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, like getting # over <eob> a cold, you could your wounds faster? <eol>
Today, xx we have an operation or # xx accident, we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars and painful <eol> side effects <eob> of our regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I xxxx to # xxxxxx <eob> materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx <eob> give <eol> the signals to <eob> grow new tissues. <eob>
like vaccines <eob> instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eol> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eol> to build tissues <eol> and quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, but there are several <eob> # organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and # even us mere <eol> can # regrow our liver after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass.
To make xxxx magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can wounds # and build # tissue <eol> through <eob> instructions <eol> from <eob> the immune system. <eol>
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying xxx immune system defends <eol> our # body from <eol> danger. <eol>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what <eob> I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eob> xxx cuts and bruises. <eol>
xxxx looking at materials that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eob> an injured xxxx these materials, <eob> xxxxx was a large number of immune xxxxx <eob> in <eob> xxxx material <eol> and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
xx in this case, <eob> instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off <eol> towards infection fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward <eob> # an injury. <eol>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of xxxxxx cell, <eol> the helper T cell, <eob> was present inside <eol> material <eob> that I implanted <eob> xxx absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were x kid <eob> and # you'd break your pencil <eol> try # and tape it back together again, <eob> can # heal, <eol> but # it might not be <eol> # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll xxx a scar. <eob>
So if # we xxxxx <eol> have <eol> these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of it, <eob> and if <eob> there's fat in our # muscle, <eob> xx xxxxx as # strong. <eol>
Now, using our immune system, <eol> our body could grow back <eob> without these <eol> scars <eol> and look like <eob> # what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eol> to build <eol> new tissue xx changing the <eob> immune
We know that any time <eol> a material # implanted <eob> in our # body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eob>
This ranges xxxx pacemakers <eob> to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials # that engineers are using <eob> xx try and new <eol>
xx when # I xxxxx that material, or # scaffold, in body, <eob> the immune creates small environment cells and proteins <eol> that change the xxx <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
just like the # weather <eob> affects our # daily activities, <eob> like # going for a run <eob> or staying and <eol> entire TV show # Netflix, <eob> immune of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eol> say the signals, <eob> we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eol>
These scaffolds # are <eol> of a different things, plastics to naturally xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx sponges that are or less porous, <eol> gels of stiffnesses. <eol>
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eol> release different signals time.
xx other # words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct stage, cues and props <eol> that can be changed # different <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of signals <eob> that mimic # how <eob> our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In # the future, # we see <eol> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # muscle filler or even a wound-healing <eol> vaccine.
Now, we aren't going to <eob> xxxx up tomorrow <eol> and be able xx heal # like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, <eob> and # working with our immune system <eol> to build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eob> to help us regenerate, and maybe one day be able xx keep pace with <eob> a salamander. <eol>
Thank you. <eob>

as a child, <eol> I used spend all of <eob> at <eol> my great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, humid, days, x would dash xxxxxx # floor <eol> xxx stick my face in # front of <eob> her only air conditioner. <eol>
But I <eol> # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though # <eol> was a privileged one in # our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eol> or having to steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me. <eol>
During <eob> # the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> xx bypass the meter <eob> after their heat shut off, <eol> xxxx to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more <eol> day. <eol>
xxxxx of dangerous <eol> incidents xxx take root when people <eob> # are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on # energy. <eob>
In # contrast, # low-income <eob> and <eob> xxxxx # xxxxxxxxxxx xxx # spend <eob> 20, 30 percent <eob> of their income on <eob> energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide # <eob> power to their homes.
This is when <eob> energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eol>
But energy burdens are xx much more than just a number. <eob>
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # <eob> you take child <eol> get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep warm?
It's an impossible choice, and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eob> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high <eol> # energy burdens are disproportionately people <eob> of color, <eob> who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, and even schoolteachers <eol> who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx <eob> million people a year <eol> who are unable to afford energy for their <eob> most needs. <eol>
As a result, those xxxx <eob> xxxx energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma. <eob>
Look -- # given rockets to Mars <eob> and our pocket-sized # <eob> we have the xxxxx to address <eob> these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is <eob>
Cost xx renewables, <eob> insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing.
even as we approach cost xxxxxxx <eob> the <eol> majority of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American.
This is why, # when I was 22, <eol> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by # <eob> with # communities, <eol> utilities and # government agencies <eob> alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eol> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eol>
But there's no one way to solve this.
I believe the power of local # communities, in the <eol> transforming effect <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
So start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eob> xxxx have the highest energy burdens.
We <eol> host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eob> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eob> and making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency.
We're connecting # <eol> xx community <eob> solar <eob> and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> smart home research <eol> and installation # programs <eob> to help families <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're even working # xxxxxxxx <eol> with xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eob> we xxxx to # work together sustainably. <eol>
Now, xxx # US spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy <eol> bill payment assistance.
And these programs do help <eol> millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only <eol> able to help <eol> fraction of # those in need. <eob>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not
But by building energy equity <eol> and # <eob> resilience into our <eol> communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to that is clean, <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At <eob> scale, # <eob> microgrid technology, clean technology and efficiency <eob> dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eol>
And for xxxxx with <eol> xxxx <eol> energy burdens, <eol> it xxx help them <eob> reclaim <eol> 20 # their income -- 20 <eol> percent of a # person's <eob> income who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eob>
This is # life-changing.
This is an opportunity <eol> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eob> to xxxxxxx their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother and xxx neighbors, <eob> the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # to make <eob> and <eol> xxx # effect # <eol> our whole xxxxxxxxxx
But this # <eob> is not just about # them. <eob>
There # are xxxxxxxx nationwide <eob> having <eob> to make the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eob> but # through relationships <eob> with <eob> communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, we <eob> will # all be more resilient. <eol>

Have ever <eob> a flock of birds work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do <eob> that <eob> if they # <eob> all would <eob> have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction <eob> # speed <eol> would <eol> simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe that these birds are aligned <eob> on <eob> x few simple rules, <eob> allowing <eob> every single bird <eol> to make autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect <eob> synchrony. <eol>
alignment enables their autonomy, <eol> and their autonomy <eob> xxxxx them xxxx and flexible. <eol>
xxxx what does this have to do <eol> with any one of <eol> # us? <eob>
Well, it's one # of xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of working # today. <eob>
The world getting faster and <eol> more complex, so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give xxx <eol>
few years ago, # I was working with a <eob> wanted to embark <eol> on a digital <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They # <eob> wanted # xxxxx offering to be simpler, <eol> intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eol>
Now, <eob> I'm not sure how many you <eol> have seen a bank from the # inside, <eob> so # let me try to illustrate xxxx many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to go <eob> to their # department, <eob> marketers # sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with xx people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? <eob> They end up <eob> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx <eob>
And there are <eob> endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
anything # done xxx take forever. <eol>
So this bank <eob> knew <eol> that in order to # transform, <eob> they would have to <eob> improve <eol> # to market <eob> by drastically xxxxxxxx <eol> their ways xx as well. <eob>
xxx <eol> how? <eol>
To get some inspiration, we decided to # go and have a look at # companies <eob> # seem to be more innovative, xxxx Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And I remember # how we xxxx <eob> walking <eol> the xxxxx at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> x management consultant <eol> and a xxxx of # bankers. <eob>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots # of # xxxxxx <eob> creative employees. <eol>
So then we asked, "How is your <eob> company <eol> organized?" <eol> we expected xx <eob> # get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eol> funny names like # "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eol> # explain they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to xxxxxxxxx <eob> that to <eob> our # own world. <eol>
We asked, "How people <eob> are <eob> working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
"Who <eob> decides your priorities?" "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were # asking # for what we thought <eol> were some # of the basic principles of organizations, <eob> and their answer xxxx <eob> "It depends".
Now, over the course of that xxxx <eol> xx gained a better <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their model.
They believed in # power <eol> of small, teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
xxxx <eob> had product people <eob> and # IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eol> independently of # others in the # company. <eob>
They did not need handovers xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had all the skills needed <eol> right there # in the team. <eob>
Now, at # the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eol> to reflect xx what we had learned. <eob>
And xx had started to like their model, xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # <eob> bank. <eob>
But xxxxx # <eob> one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all day, <eob> he <eob> suddenly said, <eob> "So I see like our # model. <eob>
But # I <eol> have one question for you: <eob> What # are willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give up?
We did not have xx answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eob>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up on some # of the old <eol> as # <eob>
Now, over the past <eob> five years, I <eob> # have # worked with companies all over the world <eob> to change their xxxx # of working.
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own skeptics <eob> about why this not going work # xxx them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> xx "They # have <eol> the # legacy IT like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators # just won't <eol> this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank and <eob> also <eob> for the other companies <eob> that I worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within <eob> a year, we # completely <eob> blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> xxxxxxxx channels and IT.
Three # employees xxxx # <eob> into # 350 teams. <eob>
So instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with product # <eob> people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a # product # person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same
You could be a member of a team responsible for account opening <eob> or the mobile banking <eol> app, etc.
At the go-live date <eol> that # new <eob> organization, some people xxxxxxx hands <eob> for the very first time, <eob> to # find out that they # had been <eol> sitting <eob> two # away from <eob> each other but they xxxx sending each # other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 # years.
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy # that # I <eol> was always chasing xxx answers". <eob> <eol>
But they're <eol> every day. <eob>
xx the product guy xxx an idea, xx can just raise <eob> to get input the engineer <eol> xxx sitting right next # to # him. <eob>
They can to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, <eob> no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red <eob> xxxxx <eol> xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eol>
Now, getting there is # not # easy. <eob>
xxx # as it turns out, <eob> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the # right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams.
of decisions <eol> up and down the organization, we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to xx so, we need all <eob> the # <eob> and expertise for that # decision <eob> in <eob> the team.
And this brings difficult trade-offs.
Can we physically co-locate our people are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or <eob> different countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way # <eob> we do things <eob> across these <eol>
We still some kind <eol> of management <eob>
Now, all these changes structure process and procedure -- <eob> xxxx # are not
in the end, <eol> I found that the # most <eol> difficult thing to change xx our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me # try to illustrate. <eob>
we # want these teams <eol> to be fast, <eob> flexible, creative, like a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, when <eol> # <eob> to do, how to <eol> do. <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that each <eob> xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eob> to take initiative. <eol>
Now # obviously, we also # <eob> cannot afford <eob> to <eob> have # all teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos.
So we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eob> at the same time, <eol> just a flock of <eob>
In <eob> an organizational setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, and with each new behavior, <eob> there # is giving up <eol> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure <eol> xxxx # <eol> everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around the overall -- # the why -- overall priorities -- the what. <eol>
then they have to let <eob> # go <eol> and trust # their # teams <eol> to make the right decisions <eob> on how to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent <eol> communication. <eol>
But you how they say <eol> that information # is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eol> sharing information may # feel as <eol> they're giving up that source of power.
it's not just managers.
xxx teams need to communicate <eol> openly <eol> and transparently well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx <eob> teams <eol> typically work # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # <eol> end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> share the output <eol> what <eob> they've transparently. <eob>
And every <eol> each # member of the gives # <eob> an update <eob> of what they are # working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can xx uncomfortable people, <eob> because there xx <eol> no place to # hide anymore.
Everything we do <eol> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone. <eol>
So, # is not easy, <eob> providing autonomy <eol> not xx <eob> obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at <eob> another company <eob> likes <eob> to explain xxx he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, # today, to know how things # are # going, <eob> instead of looking at reports, <eol> he needs to walk down the team floors <eob> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is xxxxxxx <eob> change <eob> for someone who used to xx <eob> a master of <eob>
But in the xxx <eob> world, this executive # said, "I only had the <eob> illusion xx control. <eol>
In reality, many projects would <eol> over time and xxxx budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have xxxx more <eob> and # I can course-correct much if needed". <eol>
And <eol> middle <eol> need to change as well.
First xx all, without the handovers <eol> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx for middle managers.
And in <eob> the world, there was <eol> idea of thinkers # and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of # only <eol> xxxxx people, <eob> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches. <eol>
So imagine, for the 10 <eob> you have <eob> # just <eob> been telling <eol> xxxxxx what to do, <eob> but now # you're expected to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great leave the xxxxxxxx
But the result is # a new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy.
And xxx this is hard <eob> work. <eob>
But it's worth <eob>
The that I worked # with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product a few times per year. <eob>
Now they <eob> have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eol> and <eob> the red tape, <eob> the whole # organization <eol> becomes more efficient.
And if walk the halls xx these companies today, <eob> you just a # energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet.
But at least with this new model, they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eol>
The world is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx so we need reboot <eol> our way of working. <eob>
And <eob> the hardest of that <eob> is not in structure <eob> or <eob> xxxxxxx or procedure, <eol> and it's also not just <eol> senior # executives xxxxxx charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of <eol> in the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
xx all # have xx <eol> lead change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eol>

Some of them not even <eol> to have a home base, they're xxxxxxx <eob>
they are in RVs <eob> or traveling xxxxxxx Airbnbs, <eob> xxxx are xx new places <eol> every <eol> day, week or month. <eob>
As xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on <eob> distributed work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx from the very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't the word "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eol> that some people are essential <eob> and some aren't. <eob>
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, where everyone is on # an playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed # workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> xx build a # company. <eob>
The xxx is you have to approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many the # first 20 hires were xxxxxx I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason.
I believe that talent and intelligence are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In <eob> Silicon Valley, the tech # companies fish <eob> from essentially <eob> the same small pond or # <eol> bay. <eob>
x distributed xxxxxxx <eob> can fish from xxx entire ocean.
Instead of hiring someone # grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in <eob> you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and # goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in the world. <eob> xxxx bring a different understanding of culture and a different lived experience.
At the base of <eol> to go distributed, <eob> xxxxxxx a desire to give people <eol> autonomy <eob> over xxx they # do their <eol> work. <eob>
Unless you're in a role <eob> where hours are important, <eob> you # can # your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have corner office, <eol> their windows, the # food they want to eat, <eol> you can choose when there's music and when there's silence. <eob>
You xxx what temperature <eol> the room should be.
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eol> and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # workforce <eob> xx xxxxx for x <eob> technology company. <eob>
But people often me, <eob> works great for xxxxxx <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you # have an office, <eob> you do a things to <eob> build xxxxxxxxxxx capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything.
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make <eob> decisions in # moment, <eob> in # the <eol> kitchen, # the <eob>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team <eol> are having conversations don't have <eol> xxxxxxx see these decisions made <eol> without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail where you were <eol> and what # you were thinking about.
This <eob> allows others to # pick up <eob> where you left off. <eob>
It allows in # <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, people and xxxxxx <eob>
Try to have # much # communication <eol> as possible <eob> online. <eob>
When <eol> everything's shared and public, <eol> xx # allows # new people to catch up <eob>
You also need to find <eob> the tools.
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that changed how you probably # aren't objects anymore.
xxxxxx you access <eol> through your computer. <eol>
So experiment xxxx different <eol> tools that enable <eol> see what xxxxxx <eob>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place <eol> weeks out <eol> of xxx year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks <eob>
We xxx to that: we <eol> come # together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once a <eob> year we do a grand meet-up where the entire company <eob> comes together a week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eol>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eob> We # want to make # sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on same page, and <eob> they have a deeper with their colleagues. <eob>
When they xxxx together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring xxxxxxxx <eob> that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And # the final practice: give people the to make their own work environment. <eol>
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx they can put <eob> towards a co-working space <eol> or just to buy coffee, so don't <eol> get kicked <eol> out # of the <eob> coffee shop. <eob>
One <eol> group in Seattle decided pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a workspace on a pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who <eob> the company gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is # money they can invest <eol> xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, the right desk setup, so can have <eol> the most productive environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies that are <eob> distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eob> I predict # that # 90 # percent of <eol> companies that are going to be the course of the # world <eol> are going to function this <eol>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced by those that <eob> are. <eob>
As you think xxxxx <eob> xxxx you're going to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eol> into <eob> global xxxxxxx give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eol> xxxxx # they feel they xxxxxx <eob> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eob>
