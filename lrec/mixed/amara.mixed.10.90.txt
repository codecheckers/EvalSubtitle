Imagine waking up # to a stranger -- sometimes # multiple strangers -- questioning your right to existence for <eob> something that you wrote online, <eol> waking up <eob> to an angry message, and worried <eol> for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This <eob> kind of harassment keeps women <eob> from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a form of oppression.
is # the sixth most populous <eob> country in the world, with 140 million people having access <eob> to technologies, and 15 percent <eol> internet penetration. <eob>
And this number <eob> doesn't seem to <eol> go down <eol> with the # rise xx new <eol> technologies. <eol>
Pakistan is also <eol> the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.
Another aspect <eol> is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; <eob> where men xxx allowed to # disrespect women <eol> and even kill them sometimes in the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where # women are xxxx to die <eol> right xxxxxxx their houses for speaking <eol> to a man on <eob> a mobile phone, in the name of <eol> "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very <eob> # clearly: <eob> it's <eob> not honor; <eol> it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder.
I come from a very xxxxx <eob> village in Punjab, <eob> Pakistan, where women are # allowed <eol> to pursue their xxxxxx education.
The <eob> elders of my xxxxxxxx family didn't allow their women to pursue their # education xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike other <eol> male <eob> guardians of my family, <eob> my father was one who really <eob> supported my ambitions.
To get xx law degree, of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there # were] frowns of disapproval.
But xx end, I knew <eol> it's either me or # them, and I chose myself. <eol>
(Applause)
My family's traditions <eol> and <eob> expectations for a woman <eol> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eol> phone until I was married.
And even when I xxx married, this tool xxxxxx x tool <eob> for my # own <eob> surveillance.
When # I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he # really didn't approve of and threw me out of house, <eob> with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the # time when I first asked # myself, <eob> "Why?
Why are women not allowed to enjoy <eob> the same equal <eob> xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution?
While the states that # a woman has same equal <eob> access <eob> to the information, <eob> why # xx it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands <eob> -- <eol> xxx # are granting these rights to us, xxxxxxxxxxx making the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided to take a step, instead of keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal <eob> and societal <eob> norms. <eol>
And founded the Digital <eol> Foundation in 2012 to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces <eol> and cyberharassment. <eol>
From lobbying free and <eol> safe internet <eol> to convincing young women that access to xxx safe internet <eol> is their <eob> fundamental, basic, right, I'm trying to play my part <eol> in <eol> igniting the spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eob> that have bothered me <eob> all these years.
With a hope <eob> xx my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, <eol> I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's first <eob> cyberharassment help line <eob> in December <eol> 2016 <eob> -- <eol> (Applause) <eol>
to extend <eob> my support to the women <eol> who do <eob> not know who to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online.
I think of <eob> the xxxxx who do not have the necessary support to deal with the <eob> mental trauma when they unsafe in online <eob> spaces, <eol> and they go about <eob> their # daily activities, <eol> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eol>
Safe access # to the internet is access to knowledge, and knowledge is freedom.
When I # fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting for equality. <eol>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
We're at a critical <eol> moment.
leaders, <eol> some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>

In some cases, it's because they're <eob> bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, xxxxxxx us to the wrong objectives.
this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has <eob> xx stop. <eol>
How are we going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
How are we going to # choose the right course? <eol>
It's not xxxxx to be easy. <eol>
For years, <eob> I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams <eol> they've # chosen the right objectives <eob> and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today # I'm <eol> going to share with you <eob> what really a difference -- <eol> that's what's crucial, <eol> how and <eob> they set meaningful and audacious xxxxxx the # right goals # for the right reasons. <eol>
Let's go back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've got a lot <eob> to learn, <eol> a computer engineer, <eob> I've got <eol> long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager <eob> of his <eol> or xxx other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and <eob> also a teacher, and he said <eol> to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you xxxxx <eob>
Execution xx what <eol> matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eob> called "Objectives and # Key Results".
kind xx rolls off <eob> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all about excellent <eob> execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eol>
Andy Grove: The two key <eol> phrases <eol> of <eob> the management xx # systems <eol> xxx the objectives and xxx <eob> key results, <eob> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
The objective is the direction.
The <eob> key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the xxx you can look and <eob> without any argument say, <eol> "Did I # do that, or did I do that?" Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple.
Objectives and Key Results, or xxxxx are a simple goal-setting system and they <eob> work for organizations, <eob> xxxx work for teams, <eob> they even work xxx individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what you <eob> want to have accomplished.
The key results <eol> are how I'm <eol> going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eol> many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but xxxx lack <eob> a sense of purpose to inspire their <eob> teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the right way?
First, you must answer <eob> the question, "Why?" <eol> Why? <eol>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions <eob> to their passion and to their <eob> purpose, <eob> and they develop a # clear <eol> and compelling of why.
I want to tell you a story.
work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name <eol> is Jini Kim.
She runs a called xxxxx <eob>
Nuna is a health <eob> care data company.
And <eob> when was # founded, <eob> they used <eob> data to serve <eob> the health needs <eol> of xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxx at large companies.
And then two years <eol> into the company's # life, <eob> the xxxxxxx government issued a proposal <eol> to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember that <eob> Medicaid is that that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eol> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> this database <eol> had to xx built in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> xxxx they had to honor, <eol> and they weren't # going to make very money on the project. <eob>
This was <eob> a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini seized it. <eol>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not <eol>
Why?
Well, it's a personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother # <eol> Kimong has autism.
And when <eol> he was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland.
xx fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the country <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx so it was up to Jini <eol> to xxxxxx family in Medicaid. <eol>
She <eob> # <eob> was nine years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, and # that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won <eob> and delivered on # that contract.
Here's Jini <eol> to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: <eob> saved # my from bankruptcy, <eob> xxx today it # provides xxx <eol> health <eob> and for millions of others. <eob>
Nuna is my <eol> love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row <eol> of data is # a life <eol> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with # dignity. <eol>
JD: # And Jini's # story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of <eob> why <eob> can be the launchpad <eol> for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eol>
And objectives are <eob> # significant, <eol> they're <eol> action-oriented, they <eob> are inspiring, <eol> and <eob> they're a # kind of xxxxxxx <eob> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eol> would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eol> but for years, has used <eol> OKRs <eob> to # wage a global war <eob> against poverty and disease, <eol> and <eob> xxx ONE <eob> has focused on two really gorgeous, audacious objectives. <eol>
The first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the <eob> world. <eol>
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are <eob> these good objectives?
Let's <eol> go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? # <eob> Check. <eol> Concrete? Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? <eob> Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just listen <eob> # to Bono. <eol>
(Video) <eol> Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion xxxx you to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion <eol> means nothing. <eob>
The OKR framework <eol> cultivates the <eob> madness, <eob> the chemistry contained # <eob> inside it. <eob>
It gives xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> failing is not a # fireable offense. <eol>
And when you have that sort <eob> of structure and <eob> environment <eol> and the right people, magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eol>
OKRs cultivate the <eob> madness, and magic is right <eob> # around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
So with <eob> Jini we've covered the <eob> whys, <eol> with Bono the whats # of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, the <eob> hows are the key results. That's how we meet our objectives. <eol>
And good results are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're xxxxxxxxxx but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those # are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I <eob> introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
# they are, 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And <eob> Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them. <eob>
not quite. <eob>
What # he really said was, <eob> "We # have any other way to manage this <eob> company, <eol> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
And I took that xx a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every since then, <eob> every Googler has written # down <eol> her objectives her key results. <eol>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them <eob> for everyone to see. <eol>
And these are not used for bonuses or # for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside.
They're for a higher purpose, and that's get collective <eob> commitment <eol> to # truly stretch goals.
In xxxxx a Googler, <eol> Sundar <eol> Pichai, <eob> took on <eob> an objective <eol> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> the future <eob> web -- <eol> in other words, build the browser. <eol>
He was thoughtful <eol> about how he chose his key results. <eol>
How xx you measure the xxxx # browser? <eob>
It could # be # ad clicks or <eob> engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eol> because users are going to decide <eol> Chrome is a great browser or not. <eol>
he had this one <eol> objective: build # <eob> the best browser.
And then every year <eob> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal # was 20 million users <eol> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second # year, he raised the bar to 50 million. <eol>
He # got to # 37 <eob> # million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eol>
In the third # year, he upped the # ante once <eob> more <eob> to a hundred million.
He launched an aggressive marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, improved the technology, kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 <eol>
Here's why I <eol> # like this story, <eob> not so much for # the happy ending, <eob> but it # shows <eol> someone <eob> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to <eob> it year after year after year.
It's a # perfect story for a nerd like me. <eol>
Now, I <eob> think of OKRs as transparent vessels that <eol> # are made from the whats <eob> and hows of our ambitions. <eol>
What really matters is the why <eob> that pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's <eob> why we xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not <eob> a silver <eob> bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eol> or for stronger leadership, but when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are in place, <eob> they can take you to the mountaintop.
I want you to <eol> think about your life for # a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eol>
Take time to write <eob> down your values, <eol> your objectives and your # key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eob> you can send # to # <eob> me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, of <eob> Google, <eob> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous computing, <eol> affordable health care, high-quality for <eob> everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: every one of those goals is today by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've xxxx called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eol> spreading <eob> the good gospel <eob> according to Andy Grove, but I want you <eob> to join me in this <eob> movement.
Let's xxxxx <eob> # for # <eob> what it is <eob> that really matters, <eob> because <eob> we can take xxxx <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them # to our families, <eol> to <eob> our schools, even to our # governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable.
We # can transform # those informations.
We can get back on <eob> right track <eol> if xx can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eob>
Thank # you. <eob>
(Applause)
What is history?
It <eol> is something written <eol> by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype that history <eob> should be focused on the rulers, <eol> Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, <eob> people <eol> in many countries, like mine, <eob> Russia, xxxx # at # history # as something that was predetermined or determined by the leaders, <eol> and xxxxxx people could not <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians xxxxx # do not believe <eol> that # Russia could ever have been or ever will be # x truly democratic nation, <eol> and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed <eol> to the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eob> of my # life trying to go 100 years back, <eol> to year 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I <eob> asked # myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years <eol> ago? <eob>
So last # year, we built <eob> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My <eol> team and I created software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all real diaries <eol> and letters <eol> written by # more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago.
So any <eol> user of <eol> our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow a <eol> news feed <eol> for <eob> each day of 1917 <eol> and read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought <eol> and <eob> felt.
We watch <eob> all <eol> those personalities <eob> being ordinary people like # you and me, not demigods, <eob> and # <eol> we see that history consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius ideas". <eol>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eol> used to that our country has always been an autocratic empire <eol> and the ideas xx freedom and <eob> democracy <eol> could never have <eol> prevailed, just <eol> because <eol> was not our destiny. <eol>
But if we take a broader # look, <eol> it's not <eol> that black # and <eob> white.
Yes, 1917 led to # 70 <eob> years of communist # dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we xxx that Russia <eob> could have had a different history <eob> xxx a <eob> democratic future, <eob> as any other country could or <eol> still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in world <eol> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one of first ones to grant women rights.
Knowing <eol> history and understanding <eol> how ordinary # people influenced history can help us create # better future, <eol> because history is just # a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right now. <eol>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eol> and this year, for example, <eob> xx <eol> started a new online project <eob> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary series <eob> that gives you an impression of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by <eob> global social # change that, in many ways, <eob> created the world as we know it now.
But we are making <eob> xxxx history alive <eob> by xx all the main xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a # lot individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eob> and were fighting for the same values, <eol> matter if they lived <eob> in <eol> the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people power <eob> are not the only <eob> ones <eol> making <eob> choices. <eol>
That gives any <eol> user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eol>
Journalists, scientists, <eob> philosophers # matter.
We shape society. <eol>
We all make history.
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
Computer algorithms today <eob> are performing incredible tasks <eol> with high accuracies, at # a massive scale, using human-like # intelligence. <eol>
And intelligence of computers is # <eob> often referred xx as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in <eob> the future.
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting diagnosing several life-threatening illnesses, such as # infectious diseases and <eob> cancer. <eob>
Thousands patients every year <eol> lose xxxxx lives <eol> due to liver and <eob> oral <eob> cancer.
Our # way to these patients <eol> is <eol> # to perform early xxxxxxxxx <eob> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eol>
So how do we detect # these diseases today, <eol> xxx # artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients # who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed.
Once those images are collected, <eol> another expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those <eob> images <eob> and talks to the xxxxxxxx
As xxx can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive xxxxxxxx <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is not considered practical for the developing world.
And # fact, many industrialized nations, as well.
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using intelligence? <eol>
Today, if I were to use traditional <eol> artificial # intelligence <eob> to solve this problem, I <eol> xxxxx require <eob> 10,000 <eob> -- <eol> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, x would xxxx go to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eob> those images for me. <eol>
And using those two <eob> pieces of information, <eob> I xxx train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep <eol> learning network to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx # first <eob> approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eob> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, <eob> expert physicians <eob> and <eob> expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we # more scalable, effective <eol> and more valuable artificial intelligence <eob> architectures <eol> to solve these very important <eob> problems facing # us today? <eob>
And this is <eob> exactly what my group at xxx Media Lab does. <eob>
We have <eob> invented a variety of unorthodox AI architectures to some of the most important challenges facing us today in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eol>
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, had two goals.
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required <eob> to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, we wanted # to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our <eob> first goal, instead of starting with tens and thousands of these very expensive images, <eob> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I figured out a clever way <eol> to extract billions of information <eob> packets. <eol>
These information packets <eob> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eol> xxx rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eob>
In a sense, we converted <eob> one image <eol> xxxx billions of training data points, <eol> massively reducing the amount of <eob> data <eob> needed for training. <eob>
For our <eol> second goal, to reduce the use of expensive imaging <eob> technologies to screen # patients, <eob> we <eob> started with # a standard, <eol> xxxxx light photograph, <eol> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eob> xxxxxxxx of information packets?
We overlaid those from <eob> the medical image onto this image, <eob> creating something <eob> that we call x composite image. <eob>
Much to our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images to xxxxx <eob> our algorithms <eob> to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of # using <eob> 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical <eol> we # can now <eol> train the AI algorithms <eob> in an unorthodox way, <eol> using only 50 # of these high-resolution, but standard photographs, acquired from <eol> DSLR <eol> cameras <eob> and mobile phones, <eol> and provide diagnosis.
More <eob> importantly, <eol> our algorithms can accept, <eob> in the and even <eob> right now, xxxx # very simple, white light <eol> photographs from the <eob> instead of expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies.
I <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> that we are to enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence is going to make <eob> an incredible <eol> impact xx our future. <eol>
And I think that thinking <eol> about <eol> traditional AI, <eol> xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, xx should thinking <eol> about unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data and solve some of the <eol> most important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care.
Thank you very much. <eob>

What if you could take a pill or a vaccine and, just getting over # a cold, <eob> you heal your wounds <eol> faster? <eol>
Today, if we xxxx an <eob> operation or <eob> an accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars <eob> and painful side effects <eol> of our inability to regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give us <eol> the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like <eob> vaccines instruct <eol> our body to # fight disease, <eol> we # could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues <eol> and more <eol> quickly heal wounds.
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eol> but <eob> there are xxxxxxx organisms that can achieve this feat. <eob>
lizards can regrow their tails, the <eob> humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, and even # us mere humans <eol> can regrow our # liver <eol> after xxxxxx more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body <eob> can heal wounds and build tissue through instructions <eol> from the xxxxxx system.
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that annoying sinus infection, <eol> our immune system defends <eol> our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm <eol> an <eob> immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back <eol> our cuts and bruises. <eol>
When looking at materials that <eob> are currently being # tested <eob> xxx their abilities <eol> to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating <eob> an injured # muscle with these materials, there # was a large number of immune cells <eol> in that xxxxxxxx <eol> the surrounding muscle.
So in this case, of # the immune cells rushing off <eob> towards to <eol> fight bacteria, they're rushing toward <eol> an injury.
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T <eob> xxxxx was <eob> # present inside <eol> that material that I implanted and absolutely critical <eob> for wound healing. <eol>
Now, just like xxxx you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eob> and try and tape it back together again, <eob> we can heal, <eol> but # it might not be in # <eob> the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar.
So if we don't have these helper <eob> # T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops fat cells xxxxxx xx it, and xx there's fat in our <eob> muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong.
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eob> without these # scars <eob> and look like # what xx was <eob> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working <eob> to xxxxxx materials <eol> that give us # the signals to build new tissue <eol> by changing <eob> the immune response. <eob>
We know that xxx time <eob> a material is implanted in our <eol> body, <eol> the # immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps <eob> to <eol> the materials that engineers are using <eol> to try and build new <eob>
So when I # place that material, or scaffold, in the body, <eol> the immune <eob> system creates <eol> x small environment of cells and proteins <eol> that can change the way <eol> that our stem cells <eol> behave. <eob>
Now, like the weather <eol> affects # our daily activities, <eob> like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching xx entire TV xxxx on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that <eol> xxx stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If <eob> we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of # muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eol> from plastics to naturally <eob> derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eol> sponges that more or less porous, gels # of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers <eob> can even make the materials release different xxxxxxx over time.
So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells by giving # them the <eol> correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eol> that # can be <eol> changed for <eol> different tissues, <eob> just like a producer would <eob> change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of xxxxxxx <eol> that mimic how our body responds to xxxxxx <eol> to <eob> help us regenerate.
In the <eol> future, we could see <eol> a <eob> scar-proof band-aid, a moldable muscle filler or <eob> even a <eob> wound-healing <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, we aren't <eol> going to up tomorrow <eob> and xx able to heal like Wolverine. <eol>
Probably not next Tuesday, either.
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin <eob> seeing <eob> products on the market xxxx <eol> work with our body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be xxxx to keep pace with a salamander.
Thank you. <eol>
<eob>
So, xx a child, <eol> I xxxx # to spend all of my time at <eob> my great-grandmother's house.
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash <eob> across the floor and <eol> stick my face in front xx <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But <eob> I didn't <eob> realize <eob> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eol>
Growing up, stories of <eob> next-door # neighbors having to # set up fake <eol> energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eol> seemed normal to me. <eol>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eob> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their heat was shut off, <eol> just to keep their <eol> family <eol> comfortable for one more xxxx <eol>
These kinds of dangerous <eob> incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eob> with impossible choices.
In the average American spends three percent <eob> of # their income on energy.
In contrast, <eob> # low-income <eob> and rural populations can spend xxx even <eol> 30 percent of their income energy.
In 2015, this caused over <eob> 25 million people to skip meals <eol> to <eob> provide power to their homes.
This is when energy becomes a # burden.
xxx <eol> energy burdens are <eol> so much more <eob> than just a number.
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eol> Do you take your child to get xxx flu <eob> medicine, or # do you feed <eob> her?
Or do you keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and # <eob> every month, <eol> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and <eol> energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eob> and <eol> xxxxxxxx issue.
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people # of color, <eol> who spend more per foot than # their white counterparts.
But it's also nurses, veterans <eob> and even schoolteachers who fall into <eob> the <eob> mass <eob> of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eol> have a greater xxxxxxxxxx of <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol> like heart and asthma.
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we have the <eob> tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities.
The <eol> technology is xxxxx <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eol> are <eol> xxx decreasing. <eol>
However, even as we # cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than # xxx average American.
xxxx <eob> is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded <eob> the # nonprofit RETI. <eol>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with # communities, <eob> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike <eol> xx provide equitable access to clean energy, energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology.
But there's no <eob> one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power of xxxxx communities, <eol> in the transforming effect of relationships.
So we start by working directly with the communities <eob> that have <eol> the highest energy burdens. <eol>
We host workshops and events for communities <eol> to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes like better insulation <eob> for windows and <eob> water heaters <eol> can go long way <eol> to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're <eob> connecting neighborhoods <eol> to # community <eob> solar and spearheading community-led <eob> smart home research and <eol> installation programs <eol> to help families bring down <eob> their energy bills.
even working directly <eob> with elected officials, <eol> advocating xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eol> because see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eol> have to work together sustainably. <eol>
US spends <eol> over <eol> three xxxxxxx # a year on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eob> millions of people, <eol> but they're only able to <eol> help <eol> a fraction those in need. <eol>
In fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eob> home-energy affordability gap, <eol> xx assistance <eob> alone is <eob> not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into # our communities, we can assure fair and impartial access <eol> to energy # that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eol>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eob> clean <eob> technology and energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health.
And for those with high xxxxxx burdens, <eol> it can help them reclaim <eob> 20 percent of their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a person's income who's struggling to <eol> make # ends meet. <eob>
xxxx # is life-changing. <eol>
This is an <eob> opportunity <eol> for <eol> # to # use their energy savings <eob> sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors, <eol> the impossible choices <eol> that they <eob> had to <eob> make <eob> and the effect it had <eob> on our whole community. <eol>
But this is not just about them.
There millions nationwide having to # make the same impossible choices <eol> today. <eol>
And I know high energy <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eol> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to <eob> them. <eol>
And when we do, we will all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank <eob> you.
(Applause)
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of # birds work <eob> together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in <eob> perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't <eob> it fascinating? <eol>
What I <eob> find remarkable that # these <eob> birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eol> if they all would have <eol> to follow one leader.
Their reaction speed <eob> would simply be too low.
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these birds aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eob> to <eol> autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in <eol> perfect xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Their alignment # enables their autonomy, and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eol>
Now, <eol> what does this have to do <eol> with any one of us? <eol>
Well, it's one way <eol> of illustrating what I believe to be the most important xxxxxx <eol> that <eol> is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting xxx more # complex, <eob> so we need <eob> a new <eob> way of working, <eob> a way that <eob> creates <eob> around purpose, that takes out bureaucracy and that <eob> truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions # faster. <eob>
But the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eol> what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was xxxxxxx with a bank <eol> that <eol> wanted to embark <eob> on <eol> a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They wanted their offering to be <eob> more intuitive, more <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eob> have seen a bank from <eob> the <eob> so me <eob> try <eol> to # illustrate <eob> what many traditional xxxxx look like. <eol>
You see <eol> lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to # <eob> go to <eob> their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers engineers, etc. <eob>
You <eob> see meetings with 20 people <eob> where # nothing decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eob> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers between departments. <eol>
Getting anything # can take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eol> their time to market by drastically changing <eob> their ways of working as well.
But how? <eob>
To get <eol> some inspiration, we decided <eob> to go <eob> and have a look at companies xxxx seem to # be more innovative, <eol> xxxx # Google, Netflix, <eol> # Spotify, <eob> Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how we were walking the halls at one these companies <eob> in December xxxxx a management consultant <eol> and team of # bankers.
We <eol> felt like xxxxxxxxx in a land, surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eol> and lots of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So then we <eol> asked, <eol> "How your company organized?" And we expected to xxx an org chart.
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and <eob> "tribes" <eol> to how they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to translate <eob> that to <eob> our own <eob> world.
We asked, "How many xxxxxx <eob> are working for you?" "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on your priorities?" "It depends".
You <eob> can imagine <eol> our surprise. <eob>
xx were for what we thought <eob> were some of the basic principles <eol> of organizations, <eol> their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, <eob> the course of that day, <eob> we <eob> gained a <eob> better understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were <eob> like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product <eol> people and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, build <eob> and test ideas with customers independently of others <eob> in the company. <eol>
did not need <eob> handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
They had all the skills needed <eob> right there in the team.
Now, at the end of that we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned. <eol>
And we had started xx like their model, <eob> so we <eol> were already thinking of how <eob> to apply some of <eob> these <eob> ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, a guy who <eol> had not <eob> said x xxxx all day, <eol> he suddenly said, <eol> "So I you like # our model. <eol>
But I have one question for you: What are willing to give up?" <eob> What were we # willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have <eob> an answer immediately, <eob> we <eob> knew he was right. <eol>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; it's about giving up <eob> xx some <eol> of the old as <eol> well. <eob>
Now, over xxx past <eob> five years, <eol> I <eob> have worked with companies <eob> all over the world <eob> to change their ways of <eob> working. <eol>
xxx clearly, every company has their own skeptics <eob> about why is not <eob> going to work for them. <eob>
xxxx # product <eob> is more or "They don't have <eob> xxx legacy IT like we <eol> do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eob> in our industry". <eob>
But for this # bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eol> that I have worked with <eob> afterwards, change # was possible.
Within a year, xx <eob> completely <eob> xxxx up the old silos between marketing, <eol> product, channels and # IT. <eob>
Three # thousand employees <eob> were xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> into 350 multidisciplinary teams.
xx instead <eob> of product people sitting just with product people <eol> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a product person and # an engineer xxxx now members of the same team. <eol>
You <eob> could be member of a team <eob> responsible for account opening or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eol>
At the go-live date <eob> of that new <eob> organization, <eob> some were shaking hands for the very first time, only to find out that they had been sitting two <eob> minutes away from <eol> each other but they were <eol> sending <eob> each other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 years.
You would # hear someone saying, "Ah, so you're the guy <eob> that I <eol> was always chasing answers". <eol> (Laughter)
But <eob> now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together every # day. <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, he can just raise it to <eob> get from xxx engineer <eol> who sitting right next to him. <eol>
They can <eob> decide to test <eol> with <eol> customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no <eob> red tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff done.
Now, getting there xx not easy.
as <eob> it xxxxx out, "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right <eob> question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making requires <eob> multidisciplinary <eob> teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eob> up and down the <eob> organization, <eol> want the xxxx to <eol>
But to do so, we need all the skills <eob> expertise for that decision <eol> in the team. <eob>
this <eob> brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different <eob> buildings, <eob> different cities <eob> or even <eol> different # countries today? <eol>
Or should we # invest in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eob> in the <eol> way we <eob> do things <eob> across these teams? <eob>
We still need some kind <eol> xx management matrix.
Now, all these changes xx structure <eob> and <eob> and # -- <eob> they are not <eob> easy. <eob>
But <eob> in <eob> the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eol> is our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams to be xxxxx <eob> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> xxxx have to be empowered and <eol> autonomous.
But this means we cannot have leaders <eol> xxxxxxxxxx their people what to do, <eol> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But xx xxxx xxxxx that each employee <eob> needs to <eol> xxxxxx a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eol>
It's about of us stepping up to take initiative. <eol>
Now obviously, # also cannot # <eob> to have <eol> all these xxxxx <eol> running in different directions, <eol> because that would <eob> certainly lead <eob> chaos. <eob>
xx <eol> # we need alignment and # autonomy <eob> at the same time, <eob> just like flock of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eol> and with # each new behavior, there is <eob> up <eol> on something old <eol> as well. <eol>
Leaders have to make sure <eob> that <eob> everyone the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- and the overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they <eob> have to let go and # trust their teams <eob> to xxxx xxx right decisions on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But you know how say <eol> that is <eob> a <eol> source of power? <eob>
Well, <eol> for some <eob> managers, <eol> sharing information may feel as if they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in sprints, <eol> and <eob> at the end of every sprint, <eob> they organize a demo session <eol> to share output of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eol> each # member of the team gives an <eob> update <eob> of what they are <eob> working on individually. <eol>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything do is for everyone.
xxx alignment is not easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eob> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at xxxxxxx company <eol> likes to explain how he used to be a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
Now, <eob> today, to know how things are <eol> going, <eol> instead of looking <eob> at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down xx the team floors to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And <eob> instead <eol> of telling <eob> people <eob> what do, he looks for ways # to help them.
That is radical change <eol> for xxxxxxx who used to be <eol> a master <eol> of <eol> milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in the <eol> old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control.
In reality, many projects would <eob> run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have # much more transparency, <eob> and <eol> I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if needed". <eol>
And middle managers <eol> need to change as # well.
First of all, without the handovers <eob> and the PowerPoint, there's less <eob> of a need <eob> for xxxxxx managers.
And in the old world, there was <eol> xxxx idea of thinkers and doers.
Employees would just xxxxxx orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only managing other people, <eob> middle managers were <eol> xx become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, the last years, <eol> you have just been telling other people what to do, but now you're expected <eol> to do things <eol> yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, and some great <eob> people # leave the company. <eob>
the result is a new culture <eol> with less hierarchy. <eol>
And all xx this is hard work. <eob>
But <eob> # it's worth it. <eol>
The companies that <eol> I worked with, <eol> they were used to deploying new product features a few times per <eol>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eol> and # <eob> xxxxxxx the handovers and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization becomes more efficient. <eol>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, you just feel a new <eob> energy.
It <eol> feels as if # walking <eob> the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up. <eob>
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory <eob>
But at least with this xxx # model, <eol> they are # much xxxxxx prepared to respond # to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way <eob> of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is xxx xx structure or <eob> or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eob> senior <eob> executives taking charge. <eol>
Leaders will be <eol> all of those in the # organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change.
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up? <eol>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
A leader is steady, # firm, <eob> decisive, <eol> # unwavering.
Never let 'em xxx <eol> you <eob> sweat, <eol> have an answer.
[The Way We Work] <eob> My name is # Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at # a <eol> global creative consultancy.
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, the character I xxxxxxx on Instagram. <eol>
As I thought my double life, <eob> I couldn't help but xxxxxx ... <eob>
When your <eob> xxxx self <eol> is a little nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eob> bring to xxx
For some of <eol> us <eob> is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For <eol> the first 10 years of my career, <eol> I thought there # one way to be x leader: <eob> decisive and serious.
But not me. <eol>
So <eob> I'd <eol> put on basically <eob> office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, try <eol> to hold in <eob> my hand motions.
someone who gets really excited about things, <eob> so I'd temper that.
x had this little voice in my # head, telling me, <eol> "You're too gay, <eob> too feminine, too flamboyant".
I had xxx well-intentioned <eol> adviser who <eol> said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eob> And <eob> that's
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it".
Cut to: me in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I up as my favorite TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eol> thinking friends <eob> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eol>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first # it was pure # fun. <eol>
I started these <eob> incredible <eob> messages from people <eob> about happy it made <eol> them, <eol> how it encouraged them <eol> to <eob> be <eob> their authentic selves.
And I started <eob> to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell <eob> that <eol> little voice in my head to <eob> just xxxx up and let xxxxxx be me. <eob>
But then things got a little too big. <eob>
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eob> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eol> and I got terrified: "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I thought was # going to have to get a different <eol> job. <eol>
But something happened, something small.
I got a text from my boss, <eob> it wasn't long, it just said, <eol> "Wow, xxxxxxx <eol> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eob>
And it let me put that little, <eob> scared <eol> voice away <eol> and just # be excited <eol> about this whole new world, rather than freaked out.
That's the power of one <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> sometimes all it takes one ally <eol> to <eob> make you feel comfortable.
And my <eob> coworkers <eob> started acting differently. <eol>
They became more open, <eol> more playful with me, it was as if knowing <eol> this other side of me <eob> them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease my standing with my team. <eob>
But xxxx done the opposite.
Two years in, I never imagined <eob> that this <eol> part of me # not just be embraced, <eol> but could actually help my career.
Now, I'm lucky.
I work in New York City, in an office xxxxx creativity valued <eol> and I xxx already pretty established in my when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, <eob> maybe it isn't. <eob>
all of this has taught me so much <eob> about just <eob> importance <eol> of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to work.
And it's really challenged my own misperceptions about what it takes be xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
There's no one kind of # <eob> way to be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was hard, I'd put <eol> on my perfect <eob> # mask. <eol>
Now, I can say, "Gosh, that xxx frustrating". <eol>
We can talk about challenges and <eol> struggles <eol> in an <eob> way, <eob> than everybody pretending <eob> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, is that in this <eob> big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it also believe their organization <eol> values <eol> inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eob> xxx all of our strange inner voices have a long way # to go on acceptance.
There's a big <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> between adapting <eob> and disguising.
And I think I learned that a little late.
Personally, I'm taking # all this as a call # to be the # ally <eob> who, like my # boss did for me, <eob> lets # people know that it's xx to open up.
If you're gay, <eob> or proud of your ethnic background, <eol> have x disability <eol> or are deeply religious, see what it's like <eol> being your full self # at work.
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eob>
The basic problem with xxxxxxx in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
[The # Way We Work] Howdy, my name is xxxxx <eol> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, <eol> the company behind # WordPress.com, <eol> and xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> don't care xxxxx <eob> they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed <eob> didn't happen accidentally.
It was a conscious choice <eol> the very beginning. <eol>
I don't use the word "remote," because it sets up expectation, <eol> that some people are essential and # some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe <eob> what we do, <eob> where everyone is on an # equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to build a company.
The # key is # you have <eob> to <eol> approach # it consciously.
When we started WordPress, <eol> many of the first 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd <eob> collaborated online, sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue that for one simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent intelligence <eob> are equally <eob> distributed throughout # the world. <eol> But opportunity is not.
In Valley, the big # tech companies fish <eol> xxxx <eol> essentially <eol> the same small pond or bay. <eol>
A distributed company can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead <eob> of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eol> you can gain someone who lives, works, <eol> wakes <eob> xx and goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in <eob> the world. <eol> They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture <eol> and a different lived experience. <eol>
At <eol> the base of the <eol> decision to go <eob> there's a desire to give # people autonomy over how they do their work.
Unless xxxxxx in a role <eob> where # specific <eob> hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they want to eat, you can # <eol> choose when there's music and when there's <eob>
You xxx choose what temperature <eob> the room should be. <eob>
You # can save the time you'd spend commuting and put it into <eol> that are important to <eob> you. <eob>
A distributed workforce <eol> is # ideal for a technology company.
people often ask me, <eob> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what about everyone else?" <eol> If you have an office, you can do a few things <eob> to build distributed <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx
First: document everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy <eob> to make decisions in the moment, <eol> in <eob> the <eob> kitchen, in the hall.
if people work and some members of <eob> the team <eol> are having those conversations they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions <eob> being made <eol> without understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave x trail of you were and what <eob> you were thinking # about. <eol>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off.
It <eob> allows people in different time zones to <eob> it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eob> people leaving and people joining.
Try # to <eol> # have as much communication <eob> as xxxxxxxx online.
everything's shared and public, it allows new to catch up <eob> quickly. <eol>
You also need to find the right tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, <eol> video <eol> conferencing, <eob> project management.
The xxxxxx # that changed how probably <eob> aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eob> through your computer.
So experiment with different <eol> tools that enable <eob> see what works. <eol>
Create productive, face-to-face time.
In a office, <eob> you're in the same place 48 weeks out of the year and you might have <eob> three four weeks apart. <eob>
We xxx to # that: we come together for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a # year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play. <eol>
The primary goal # is connecting people. We want to make <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eol> and they have a deeper connection <eob> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work together <eob> the rest of <eol> the year, <eol> they # can bring together that <eob> understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment.
Every person Automattic <eol> has <eol> a co-working stipend <eol> that they can put <eol> towards a <eol> co-working <eol> xxxxx <eob> or <eob> just to # buy coffee, so don't <eob> get xxxxxx out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together and rented a workspace on a fishing pier.
Each person who joins the company <eob> gets a home-office stipend.
This is money they can xxxxxx <eol> in getting the right monitor, <eol> the right <eob> desk setup, so they can have the most productive environment <eob> for xxxxx <eob>
Today, there are xxxx a few companies that are distributed <eob> first.
In a decade or <eob> xxxx I predict that 90 percent companies <eol> that are to be changing <eob> the course of <eob> the world <eob> going xx function this # way.
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced <eol> by those that are. <eob>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eol> how you can tap into global talent, <eob> xxxx people autonomy to live and work <eob> where # they feel they should and still # participate fully in whatever <eob> is that you're creating together. <eob>
