Imagine waking up # to a stranger -- <eol> sometimes # multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eob> and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
kind of harassment that women <eol> face in Pakistan is serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is # the sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the # rise xx new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their <eob> bodies; <eob> where men xxx allowed to # disrespect women <eol> and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where # women are xxxx to die <eol> right xxxxxxx their houses <eol> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very # clearly: it's not honor; <eob> it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder. <eob>
I come from a very xxxxx village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are # allowed <eol> to pursue their xxxxxx education. <eol>
The elders of my xxxxxxxx family <eol> didn't allow <eob> their women <eob> to pursue their # education <eol> xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions.
To get xx <eob> law degree, <eol> of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there # were] frowns of disapproval. <eob>
But xx end, I knew it's either me or # them, <eob> and I chose myself.
(Applause) <eob>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile phone until I was married. <eol>
And even when I xxx married, <eob> this tool xxxxxx x tool <eol> for my # own surveillance. <eol>
When # I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of <eob> and threw me out <eol> of house, <eob> with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the # time <eol> when I first asked # myself, "Why? <eol>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution? <eob>
While the states that # a woman <eol> has same equal access <eob> to the information, <eob> why # xx it always men <eob> -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> xxx # <eol> are granting these rights <eol> to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided to take a step, <eob> instead of keep questioning these patriarchal <eob> and societal norms.
And founded the Digital Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues <eol> and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment.
From lobbying free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women <eob> that access to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have bothered me all these years.
With a hope xx my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- <eol> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the women <eol> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online. <eob>
I think of the xxxxx who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to <eob> deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go about their # daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box.
Safe access # to the internet <eol> is access to <eob> knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I # fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause)
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eol> are failing us. <eob>
<eob>
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, xxxxxxx us to the wrong objectives. <eol>
this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has xx stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
How are we going to # choose the <eob> right course? <eob>
It's not xxxxx to <eob> be easy. <eob>
For years, I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams <eob> they've # chosen the right objectives <eob> and the wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today # I'm going to share with you <eob> what really a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eob> how and <eol> they set meaningful and audacious xxxxxx <eob> the # <eol> right goals # for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've got a lot to learn, <eol> a computer engineer, <eol> I've got long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been <eol> called the <eob> greatest manager <eol> of his or xxx other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, <eob> it almost doesn't matter what you xxxxx <eob>
Execution xx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and # Key Results". <eob>
kind xx rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
And it's all about <eob> excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management xx # systems <eob> xxx the objectives and xxx key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the xxx you can look <eol> and without <eob> any argument say, <eol> "Did I # do that, or did I do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John <eob> Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and <eol> Key Results, <eob> or xxxxx <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for <eob> organizations, xxxx work for teams, they even work xxx individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eol>
The key results are how <eob> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eob> and <eob> most of us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them.
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eol> they make their numbers, <eob> but xxxx lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the right way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eob> the question, "Why?" Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions <eol> to their passion and to <eol> their purpose, <eob> and they develop a # clear and <eol> compelling of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
work <eob> with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a called xxxxx <eob>
Nuna is a health <eob> care data company.
And when was # founded, <eob> they used data to serve the health needs <eol> of xxxx of xxxxxxx at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's # life, <eob> the xxxxxxx government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children <eob> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> this database <eol> had to xx built in one year, <eob> and <eol> they had a whole set <eol> of commitments <eol> xxxx they had to honor, <eob> and they weren't # going to make <eol> very money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eol> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She <eol> did not <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
xx fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eol>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the country <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx so it was up to <eob> Jini <eol> to xxxxxx family in Medicaid. <eob>
She # was nine years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and # that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on # <eob> that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: <eol> saved # my from bankruptcy, <eob> xxx today it # provides xxx health <eol> and for millions of others. <eol>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eob> to be told with # dignity. <eol>
JD: # And Jini's <eob> # story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of <eob> why <eob> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eol> they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a # kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, has used OKRs <eob> to # wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx ONE <eol> has <eob> focused on two really gorgeous, audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eob> to <eob> anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good objectives?
Let's go back to our checklist. <eol>
Significant? # Check. <eob> Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just <eob> listen # <eob> to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> xxxx you <eob> to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
The <eol> OKR <eol> framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained # inside it. <eob>
It <eob> gives xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, <eob> for trust, <eol> failing is not a # fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> of <eol> structure and environment <eob> and the right people, magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right # <eob> around the corner. <eob>
This <eob> is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eol> with Bono the whats # of goal-setting.
Let's turn our attention to the <eob> hows. <eob>
Remember, the hows <eob> are <eob> the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're xxxxxxxxxx but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those # are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
# they are, <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
not quite. <eob>
What # he really said was, <eob> "We # <eob> have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I took that xx a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every since then, <eob> every Googler <eol> has written # down <eob> her objectives her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eol> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or # for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's get collective commitment <eob> to # truly stretch goals. <eob>
In xxxxx a Googler, <eob> Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eol> which was to build the next generation client platform <eob> the future web -- <eob> in other words, build the browser. <eob>
He was thoughtful <eol> about how he chose his key results.
How xx you measure the xxxx # browser? <eob>
It could # be # ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
he had this one objective: <eol> build # the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal # was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10.
Second # year, he raised <eol> the <eob> bar to 50 million. <eob>
He # got to # 37 # million users. <eob>
Somewhat better.
In the third # year, <eob> he upped the # ante once more <eol> to <eob> a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, kaboom!
He got 111 <eob>
Here's why I # like this story, <eob> not so much for # the happy ending, <eob> but it # shows someone <eol> carefully choosing <eob> the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a # perfect story for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eob> that # <eol> are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why <eol> that pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's why we xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver <eol> bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, but <eob> when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eol> about your life for # a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, <eol> your objectives and your # key results.
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eob> you can send # to # me.
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we think of the world-changing <eob> goals <eob> of Intel, of <eob> a Nuna, of Bono, <eol> of Google, <eob> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable health care, <eol> high-quality <eol> for everyone, ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all the world's information.
Here's the deal: <eol> every one of those goals <eol> is today by OKRs.
Now, I've xxxx called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of <eol> OKRs spreading the <eob> good gospel <eob> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement.
Let's xxxxx # for # what it <eob> is <eol> that really matters, <eol> because we can take xxxx beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them # to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eol> even to our # governments. <eol>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eob>
We # can transform # those informations. <eob>
We <eob> can get <eol> back on right track <eob> if xx can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eob>
Thank # you. <eob>
(Applause)
What is history?
It is something written by the winners. <eol>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> Lenin or Trotsky. <eol>
As a result, people <eob> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> xxxx # at # history # as something <eob> that was predetermined <eob> or <eob> determined by the leaders, <eob> and xxxxxx people could not <eol> influence it in <eol> any way. <eol>
Many Russians xxxxx # do not believe <eol> that # <eob> Russia could ever <eob> have been <eol> or ever will be # x truly democratic nation, and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed <eob> to the citizens <eol> of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my # life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to year 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I <eob> asked # myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
So last # year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My team and I <eob> created software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eob> all real diaries and letters <eob> written by # <eob> more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow a news feed <eol> for each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eol> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eob> being ordinary people like # you and me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and # we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eol> used to that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas xx freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because was not our destiny. <eob>
But if we take a broader # look, <eob> it's not that <eob> black # <eol> and white.
Yes, 1917 led to # 70 <eol> years <eol> of communist # dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we xxx that Russia <eol> could have had a different history <eob> xxx a democratic future, <eol> as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in world <eob> to <eob> abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one of first ones <eob> to grant women rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary # people influenced history <eob> can help us create # better future, <eob> because history is just # a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening <eol> right now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, <eob> xx started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary series <eob> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked <eol> by global social # change <eob> that, in many ways, created the world <eol> as we know it now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx history alive <eob> by xx all the main <eol> xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a # lot individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eob> and were fighting for the same values, <eob> matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people power <eol> are not the only ones making choices.
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an impact.
Ideas matter.
Journalists, scientists, philosophers # matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eob>
We all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eol> with high accuracies, at # a massive scale, <eol> using human-like # intelligence. <eob>
And intelligence of computers <eob> is # often referred xx as AI or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to an incredible impact <eol> on our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as # infectious diseases and cancer.
Thousands patients every year lose xxxxx lives <eob> due to liver and oral cancer.
Our # way to these patients <eob> is # to perform early xxxxxxxxx <eol> and <eob> diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect # these diseases today, <eol> xxx # artificial <eol> intelligence help? <eob>
In patients # who, unfortunately, are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eol> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images <eob> are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those images and talks to the xxxxxxxx <eob>
As xxx can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive xxxxxxxx <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is not considered practical <eol> for the developing world. <eob>
And # fact, many <eol> industrialized nations, as well.
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using intelligence? <eob>
Today, if I were to use traditional <eol> artificial # intelligence to <eob> solve this problem, <eob> I xxxxx require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After <eol> that, <eob> x would xxxx go to an expert physician, who <eob> would then analyze <eol> those images for me. <eob>
And using those <eol> two pieces of information, <eob> I xxx train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx # first approach, <eol> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert medical imaging technologies.
So, can we # more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing # us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at xxx Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eob> of unorthodox AI architectures <eob> to some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today in medical imaging and clinical <eob> trials. <eob>
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, had two goals. <eob>
Our first <eob> goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we <eob> were more ambitious, we wanted # to reduce the use <eob> of expensive medical imaging <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, instead of starting with <eol> tens and thousands <eol> of these very expensive images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eob> figured out a clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information packets.
These information packets <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry xxx rendering of the disease on the medical image.
In a sense, we converted one <eol> image <eol> xxxx billions of training data points, <eob> massively <eob> reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for <eob> training. <eob>
For our second goal, <eol> to reduce the use of expensive <eol> imaging technologies to screen # patients, <eol> we started with <eob> # a standard, <eol> xxxxx light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile phone, for the patient.
Then remember those <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob> of information packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from the medical image onto this image, <eol> creating something that we call x composite image. <eol>
Much to our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images to xxxxx <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eol> instead of # using 10,000 very expensive medical <eol> we # can now train the AI algorithms <eob> in an <eob> unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 # of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the and even right now, xxxx # very simple, white light <eol> photographs from the <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eol>
I xxxxxxx that we are <eob> to enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make an incredible <eol> impact xx our future. <eob>
And I think that <eob> thinking <eol> about traditional AI, xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just getting over # a cold, <eob> you heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, if we xxxx <eob> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars <eob> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give <eob> us <eol> the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to # fight disease, <eob> we # could instead instruct our immune <eol> system <eob> to build tissues <eol> and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, <eol> but there are xxxxxxx organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
lizards can regrow their tails, the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and even # us mere humans <eob> can regrow our # liver <eob> after xxxxxx more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the xxxxxx system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that annoying sinus infection, <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm <eol> an immunologist, <eol> and by using what I know about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eol> in our fight to build back <eol> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being # tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured # muscle with these materials, <eob> there # was a large number of immune cells <eol> in that xxxxxxxx <eol> the surrounding muscle. <eob>
So in this case, <eob> of # the <eob> immune cells rushing off <eol> towards to fight bacteria, they're rushing toward an injury. <eol>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eol> the helper T xxxxx <eob> was # present inside <eol> that <eob> material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely <eob> critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like xxxx you were <eob> a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eol> and try and tape it back together again, <eob> we <eol> can heal, <eob> but # <eob> it might not be in # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't <eob> have <eob> these helper # T cells, <eol> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx xx it, and xx there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, our <eob> body could grow back <eol> without these # scars <eob> and look <eob> like # what xx was before we <eol> were even injured. <eol>
I'm working to xxxxxx materials <eob> that give us # the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response.
We know that xxx time <eob> a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the # immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from <eol> pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers are using <eol> to try and build new <eol>
So when I # place that material, <eob> or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system creates <eol> x small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the way <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, like the weather <eol> affects # our daily activities, <eol> like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eob> xx entire TV xxxx on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way <eol> that <eol> xxx stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong <eol> signals, say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of # muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds made <eob> of a variety of different things, <eob> from plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that more or less porous, <eob> gels # of different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different xxxxxxx over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eob> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving # them the correct <eob> stage, cues and props <eob> that # can be changed for different tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eob> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of xxxxxxx <eob> that mimic how our body responds to xxxxxx to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eol> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, we aren't going to up tomorrow <eob> and xx able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eol>
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system <eol> to help build tissue and heal wounds, we could begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eol> xxxx <eob> work <eol> with our body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be xxxx <eol> to <eob> keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

So, xx a child, <eol> I xxxx # to spend all of my time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across <eol> the floor <eob> and stick my face in front xx <eol> her <eol> only air <eol> conditioner. <eol>
But I didn't <eob> realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of <eob> next-door # neighbors <eol> having to # set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep <eol> their family <eol> comfortable for one <eob> more xxxx <eob>
These kinds of dangerous <eol> incidents <eol> can take root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the average American spends <eol> three percent of # their income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, # low-income <eol> and rural populations can spend xxx even 30 percent <eol> of their income energy. <eol>
In 2015, this <eob> caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes.
This is when energy becomes a # burden. <eol>
xxx energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to get xxx flu medicine, <eob> or # do you <eob> feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her <eol> warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and # every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eob> between medicine and energy.
This exposes a much larger <eob> and xxxxxxxx issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people # of color, <eol> who spend more per foot <eob> than <eol> # their white counterparts. <eol>
But it's also nurses, veterans <eol> and even schoolteachers who fall into the mass of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a <eob> greater xxxxxxxxxx of xxxxxxxxxx <eob> like heart and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we have the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is xxxxx <eol>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eob> are xxx decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we # cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than # xxx average American. <eol>
xxxx is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded the # nonprofit RETI. <eol>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike <eob> xx <eob> provide equitable access <eol> to <eob> clean energy, energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eob> of xxxxx communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eol>
So we start by working directly <eob> with the communities that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities to learn about energy poverty, <eol> and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to # community solar <eol> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation programs <eob> to <eob> help families bring down <eol> their energy bills. <eob>
even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eol> advocating <eol> xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eob> because see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> have to work together sustainably. <eob>
US spends <eob> over three xxxxxxx # a year on energy bill payment <eol> assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but they're only able to help <eol> a fraction those in need. <eob>
In fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, xx assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and <eob> resilience into # <eob> our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eol> to energy # that is clean, <eob> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health. <eol>
And for those with <eob> high xxxxxx burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make # ends meet. <eob>
xxxx # is life-changing. <eob>
This is an opportunity <eol> for # to # use their energy savings <eob> sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back <eob> to my great-grandmother <eol> and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eob> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on our whole community. <eol>
But this is not just about them.
There millions nationwide having <eol> to # make the same impossible choices today.
And I know high <eol> energy <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to them. <eob>
And when we do, we will all be more resilient. <eol>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of # birds <eob> work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable that # these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eob> would simply be too low.
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds aligned on a few simple rules, allowing every single bird <eol> to autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Their alignment # enables their autonomy, <eol> and their autonomy makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eol> with any one of us? <eol>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what I believe to be the most important xxxxxx <eob> that is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting <eob> xxx more # complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that creates <eob> around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions # faster. <eob>
But the question is: <eob> In order to <eol> get there, <eol> what <eol> are we willing to give up? <eol>
A few years ago, I was xxxxxxx with a bank <eob> that wanted to embark on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They wanted their offering to be <eob> more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you have seen a <eol> bank from the <eol> so me try to # illustrate <eol> what many traditional xxxxx look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to # go <eol> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with 20 people <eol> where # nothing decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything <eob> # can take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eol> their time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eob> their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided to go and have a look <eob> at companies <eob> xxxx seem to # be more innovative, <eol> xxxx # Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how we were walking <eol> the halls at one these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eol> a management consultant <eol> and team of <eol> # bankers. <eob>
We felt like <eob> xxxxxxxxx in a land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots of smart, creative employees.
So then we asked, <eol> "How your company organized?" <eob> And we expected to xxx an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, "How many xxxxxx are working for you?" <eol> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends".
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
xx were for what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> their was, "It depends". <eol>
Now, the course of that day, <eob> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eob> and IT engineers in the same team so they could design, build and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of others in the company. <eob>
did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eol> right there <eol> in the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of that <eol> we had a session <eob> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started xx like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how <eol> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said x xxxx all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I you like # our model. <eob>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are willing to give up?" <eob> What were we # willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, we knew he was right.
Change is not only about embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> xx some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, <eob> over xxx past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world to change their ways of working. <eob>
xxx clearly, every company <eob> has their own skeptics <eob> about why is not <eol> going to work for them.
xxxx # product is more or <eob> "They don't have <eol> xxx legacy IT like we do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our <eob> industry".
But for this # bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change # was possible. <eol>
Within a <eob> year, xx completely <eol> xxxx up the old silos <eol> between marketing, product, channels and # IT. <eob>
Three # thousand employees were xxxxxxxxxxx into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
xx instead of product people sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, a product person and # an engineer <eol> xxxx now members of the same team. <eob>
You could be member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile <eol> banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live <eob> date <eol> of that new organization, <eob> some were shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eob> only to find <eol> out that they had been <eol> sitting two <eob> minutes away from each other but they were sending each other emails <eob> and status reports for the last 10 years. <eob>
You would # hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that I was always chasing answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together every <eol> # day. <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he <eol> can just raise it <eob> to get from xxx engineer <eol> who sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting there xx not easy. <eob>
as it xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams.
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and down the organization, <eob> want the xxxx to <eob>
But to do so, we <eob> need all the skills <eol> expertise <eol> for that decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our <eol> people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eob> different # countries today? <eob>
Or should we # invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency in the way <eob> we do things <eol> across these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes xx structure <eob> and and # -- <eob> they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eol> I found that the most difficult thing to change is our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me try to illustrate.
If we want these teams to be xxxxx flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eol> xxxx have to be empowered and autonomous. <eol>
But this means we cannot have leaders xxxxxxxxxx their people what to do, <eol> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But xx <eob> xxxx xxxxx that each employee <eob> needs to xxxxxx a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's <eob> about of us stepping up to take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, # also cannot # <eob> to have all these xxxxx <eol> running <eob> in different directions, <eob> because that <eol> would <eol> certainly lead chaos. <eob>
xx # we need alignment and # autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eob> just like flock of birds.
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and with # each new behavior, <eob> there is up <eol> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> that everyone the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what.
But then they have to let go <eol> and # trust their teams <eob> to xxxx xxx right decisions <eol> on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and transparent <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But you know how say that is a source of power? <eol>
Well, for some managers, sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eol> each # member of the team gives an update <eob> of what <eob> they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, <eob> because suddenly, there is <eob> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything <eob> do <eol> is for everyone. <eob>
xxx alignment is not easy, <eob> and providing autonomy <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at xxxxxxx company <eob> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down xx the team floors <eol> to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And instead of telling people what do, <eob> he looks for ways # to help them. <eob>
That is radical change <eob> for xxxxxxx who used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had <eol> the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many <eob> projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have # much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct much earlier if needed". <eob>
And middle managers <eol> need to change as # well.
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eol> for xxxxxx managers. <eob>
And in the old world, there was <eol> xxxx idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just xxxxxx orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other people, <eob> middle managers were <eol> xx become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, the last years, <eol> you have just been telling other people what <eob> to do, <eol> but now you're <eob> expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eol>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great people # leave the company. <eol>
the result is a new culture <eob> with less <eol> hierarchy. <eob>
And all xx this is hard work. <eol>
But # it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per <eob>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eob> and # xxxxxxx the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eol> the whole <eob> organization <eob> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if # walking <eol> the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up.
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory <eob>
But at least with this xxx # model, <eob> they are # much xxxxxx prepared <eol> to respond # to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is xxx xx structure or or procedure, and it's also not just <eob> senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of those <eob> in the # organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We <eol> all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>

[The Way We Work] <eob> My name is # Dan, I'm a <eob> partner <eol> at # a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I xxxxxxx on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought my double life, <eol> I couldn't help but xxxxxx ... <eob>
When your xxxx self <eob> is a little nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to xxx <eob>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eol> I thought there # <eob> one way to <eob> be x leader: decisive and serious. <eob>
But not me. <eol>
So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper <eob> voice, <eol> try to <eol> hold <eob> in my hand motions. <eob>
someone who gets <eol> really excited about <eob> things, <eob> so I'd temper that. <eob>
x had this little voice <eol> in my # head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had xxx well-intentioned <eob> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. And that's <eol>
But you don't need <eob> to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: me in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, thinking friends <eob> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first # it was pure # fun. <eob>
I started these incredible <eol> messages from people <eol> about happy it made them, <eob> how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eol>
And I started to think, <eol> maybe this is the time to tell that <eob> little voice in my head to just xxxx up <eob> and let xxxxxx be me. <eol>
But then things got a little too big.
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eol> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eob> and <eol> I got terrified: <eob> "What <eob> would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I thought was # going to have to <eol> get a different job. <eob>
But something happened, <eol> something small. <eob>
I got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, "Wow, xxxxxxx <eob> With a link to an article that had <eob> just gone up about me. <eob>
And it let me put that little, <eol> scared voice away <eob> and just # be excited <eol> about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one xxxxxxx <eob> sometimes all it takes one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became <eob> more open, more playful with me, it was as if knowing this other side of me <eob> them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eob>
But xxxx done the opposite.
Two years in, <eob> I never imagined that this <eol> part of me # not just be embraced, but could actually help my career. <eob>
Now, I'm <eol> lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, in an office xxxxx creativity valued <eob> and I xxx already pretty established <eol> in my when all of <eob> this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't. <eob>
all of this has taught me so much <eob> about just importance <eol> of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to work. <eol>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eob> about what it takes be xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
There's no one kind <eob> of # way to be a leader. <eol>
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them.
Before, if a meeting was <eob> hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect # mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eol> "Gosh, that <eob> xxx frustrating". <eob>
We can talk about challenges <eol> and struggles in an way, <eob> than everybody pretending <eol> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing <eob> you were someone different. <eob>
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, <eol> is that in this big <eob> study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> xxx all of our strange <eob> inner <eob> voices <eob> have a long way # to go on acceptance. <eol>
There's a big xxxxxxxxxx between adapting and disguising.
And I think I learned that a little late.
Personally, I'm taking # all this <eol> as a call # to be the # ally <eob> who, like my # boss did for me, <eol> lets # people know that it's xx to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eob> of your ethnic background, have x disability or are deeply <eob> religious, <eob> see what it's like <eol> being your full self # at work. <eob>
You might be pleasantly surprised.
The basic problem <eol> with xxxxxxx in an office is you're just not in <eob> control <eol> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eob> they are new places <eol> every day, week <eob> or month. <eob>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> don't care xxxxx they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It <eol> was a conscious choice <eol> the very beginning.
I don't use the word "remote," <eol> because it sets up expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and # some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on an # equal playing field. <eob>
I think <eol> a distributed workforce is the most effective way <eol> to build a company. <eob>
The # key is # you have to <eob> approach # it consciously.
When we started WordPress, many of the first 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eol>
But <eob> we'd <eob> collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eol>
wanted to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eob>
I believe that <eob> talent intelligence are equally distributed <eol> throughout # the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Valley, <eol> the big # tech companies fish <eob> xxxx essentially <eol> the same small pond or bay.
A distributed company <eob> can <eob> fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who <eob> lives, works, <eol> wakes xx and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. They bring a different <eob> understanding of <eob> that culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eol>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go there's a <eol> desire to give # people autonomy <eol> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless xxxxxx in a role <eol> where # specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner <eob> office, <eol> their windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you can # choose when there's music <eol> and when there's <eob>
You xxx choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You # can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed workforce <eol> is # ideal for a <eob> technology company. <eob>
people often ask me, <eol> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what <eol> about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eob> you can do a few things <eol> to build distributed xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the hall.
if people work <eol> and some members of the team <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave x trail of you were <eol> and what you were thinking # about. <eob>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eol>
It allows people in different time zones to <eob> it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eob> people leaving and people joining. <eob>
Try # to # have as much <eob> communication <eol> as xxxxxxxx online. <eob>
everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows <eob> new to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # that <eob> changed how <eol> probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> tools that enable <eob> see what works. <eol>
Create productive, <eob> face-to-face time. <eob>
In a office, <eol> you're in the same place <eol> 48 weeks <eol> out of the year <eob> and you might have <eol> three four weeks apart.
We xxx to # that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a # year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company comes together for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal # is connecting people. <eob> We want to make everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eob> and they have a deeper connection <eob> with their colleagues.
When they work together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they # can bring together <eol> that understanding and <eol> empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make <eol> their own work environment. <eob>
Every person Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eol> that they can put <eol> towards a co-working xxxxx <eob> or just to # buy coffee, so don't <eol> get xxxxxx out of the coffee shop. <eol>
One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together <eol> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they can xxxxxx <eob> in getting the right monitor, the right desk setup, <eol> so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for xxxxx <eob>
Today, there are xxxx a few companies <eol> that are distributed <eob> first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict that 90 percent companies <eob> that are to be changing <eol> the course of the world going xx function this # way. <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, or they'll be replaced <eob> by those that are. <eob>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eob> how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eob> xxxx people autonomy to live and work <eol> where # they <eol> feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully in whatever <eol> is that you're creating together. <eob>
