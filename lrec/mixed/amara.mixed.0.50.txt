Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eol> sometimes multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence for <eob> something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of harassment that women <eol> face in Pakistan is very serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> from accessing the internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge.
It's a form <eol> of oppression.
Pakistan is the sixth most populous <eob> country in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access <eob> to mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with <eol> the rise of new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their bodies; <eob> where men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> and even kill them sometimes in the name of so-called "family honor"; <eob> where women are left to die <eol> right outside their houses for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name <eol> of "family <eob> honor". <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a very small village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eol> didn't allow their women <eol> to pursue their higher education or their professional careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eol> my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions.
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
But in the end, I knew <eol> it's either me or them, <eol> and I chose myself. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
My family's traditions and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eob> phone until I was married.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool <eol> for <eob> my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this <eol> and threw me out <eob> of his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the time <eob> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eob> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our Constitution? <eob>
While the law states that a woman <eol> has the same equal access to the information, <eob> why is it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> who <eob> are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to take a step, instead of keep questioning these patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I founded the Digital Rights <eob> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women <eob> that <eol> access to the safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part <eob> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the questions <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With a hope in my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eob> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- (Applause) <eol>
to extend my support to the women <eob> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they face serious threats online. <eol>
I think of the women who <eol> do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe in <eol> online spaces, <eob> and they go about their daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the internet is an access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at <eol> a critical moment. <eol>
Our leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions are failing us.
Why?
In some cases, it's <eob> because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
And this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has to stop. <eob>
How are we <eol> going <eol> to correct these wrongs? <eob>
How are we going to choose the right course?
It's not going to be easy. <eol>
For years, I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen the right objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to share with you <eob> what really makes a difference -- that's what's crucial, <eob> how and why <eob> they set <eob> meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to 1975. <eob>
Yep, this is me. <eob>
I've got a <eob> lot to learn, <eol> I'm <eol> a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eol> who's been called the greatest manager <eol> of his or any other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, <eol> it almost <eol> doesn't <eol> matter what you know.
Execution is what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy <eol> invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and Key Results". <eob>
It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eol>
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management by objective systems <eob> are the objectives and the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can look and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I do that, or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they <eob> work for organizations, <eol> they work for teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are <eob> what you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how I'm going <eob> to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eol> and most of us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and meet them.
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
So <eob> how do you set <eol> these goals the <eob> right way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eob> the question, "Why?" <eol> Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions <eol> to their passion and to their purpose, <eob> and they develop a clear <eob> and compelling sense of why.
I <eob> want to tell you a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim.
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna <eol> is a health care data company.
And when Nuna was <eol> founded, <eob> they used data to serve the health <eob> needs <eol> of lots of workers at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, <eol> the federal government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever <eob> cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> and this database <eob> had to be built in one year, and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> that <eol> they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, <eob> he had his first <eob> grand mal seizure <eol> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped <eol> breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eol>
They came to the country <eob> with limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it <eob> was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eob> saved my family from bankruptcy, and today it provides for Kimong's health <eob> and for millions of others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eol>
Every row of data is <eob> a life <eol> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad <eob> for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are significant, <eol> they're action-oriented, <eob> they are inspiring, and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eol>
You think a rockstar <eol> would be an unlikely user <eob> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono has used OKRs to wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal <eol> access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.
Action-oriented? Yes.
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate?
What actions does your passion <eol> lead you to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eol>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eol> the chemistry contained inside it.
It gives us an environment for risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing is not a fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that <eob> sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eol> magic is around <eol> the corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eol> with Bono the whats <eob> of goal-setting.
Let's turn our <eob> attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, the hows are the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're <eob> aggressive but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those <eob> are good key results.
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey. <eol>
Here they are, <eob> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eol>
Well, not quite. <eob>
What he really said was, <eob> "We don't <eob> have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter)
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> her objectives and her key results. <eol>
They've graded them, <eol> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're <eol> set aside. <eob>
They're used for a higher purpose, <eol> and that's to get collective commitment <eol> to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> for the future of web applications -- <eob> in other words, build <eol> the best browser. <eol>
He was very thoughtful about how he chose his key results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of users, because users are going <eob> to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had this one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eob> he stuck to the same <eol> key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eol>
In the first year, <eob> his goal was 20 million <eob> users <eob> and <eob> he missed it. <eol>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he <eob> raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the <eol> third year, <eob> he upped the ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, broader distribution, <eob> improved the <eob> technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He <eob> got 111 million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, but it shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the <eob> right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels <eol> that <eol> are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eol>
What really matters <eol> is the why <eol> that we pour into those vessels. <eol>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going <eob> to be <eob> a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but <eob> when those fundamentals are in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.
I want you <eob> to think about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eol>
Do it today.
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eol> you can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we <eob> think of the world-changing goals of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eol> they're remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable health care, high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access to <eol> all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every <eob> one of those goals <eol> is powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading the good gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that really matters, <eob> because we can take OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them to our families, <eol> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable.
We can transform those informations. <eol>
We can get back on the right track <eob> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What <eol> is history? <eol>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or determined by the <eob> leaders, <eob> and common people could not <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not <eob> believe that Russia could ever have been or ever will be a truly democratic nation, <eob> and this is due to the way history has been <eob> framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eob> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to <eob> the year 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I asked myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we built <eob> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user <eob> of our website or application can follow a news feed <eol> for each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eol> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like you and me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, who used to think that our country <eob> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy was not our destiny. <eob>
But if we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we see that Russia <eol> could have had a different history <eob> and a democratic <eol> future, as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one of the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eob> how ordinary people influenced history can <eob> help us create a <eol> better future, <eob> because history is just a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right now. <eob>
We <eob> do need new <eob> ways of telling history, and <eol> this year, for example, <eob> we started <eob> a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, and that is an online documentary series <eob> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by global social change <eob> that, in many ways, <eob> created the world <eob> as we know it now.
But we are making that history alive <eob> by imagining what if all the main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... just like that? <eob>
And we see that a lot of individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same <eob> values, no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people in power <eol> are not the only ones making choices. <eob>
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They <eob> have an <eol> impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eob> philosophers <eob> matter. <eol>
We shape society. <eob>
We all <eob> make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
Computer algorithms <eol> today are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using human-like intelligence.
And this intelligence of computers is often referred to as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to make an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in the future. <eol>
Today, however, <eob> we still <eol> face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eob> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious diseases and cancer. <eol>
Thousands of patients every <eob> year <eol> lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our best way to help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected <eol> of these diseases, an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images <eob> are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and <eol> talks to the patient. <eol>
As you can see, this is <eob> a very resource-intensive process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is not considered practical for the developing world.
And in fact, in many <eob> industrialized nations, as well. <eol>
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using artificial intelligence? <eol>
Today, if I were to use traditional artificial intelligence architectures <eol> to solve this problem, I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical images <eol> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then go to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eol> those images for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, I can train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large amounts of data, expert physicians and expert medical imaging technologies. <eol>
So, <eol> can we invent more <eob> scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems <eob> facing us <eob> today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eob> what my group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures <eol> to solve some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials.
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first <eol> goal was <eob> to reduce <eob> the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eol> to screen patients.
So how <eol> did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eol> instead of starting <eol> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eob> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information packets.
These information packets included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image.
In a sense, we converted one image <eol> into billions of <eob> training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for <eob> training. <eob>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eol> we started with a standard, <eol> white <eob> light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> or a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those billions of information packets?
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, <eol> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image.
Much to our <eob> surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- <eol> of these composite images to train our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 very expensive medical images, we can now train the AI algorithms <eol> in an unorthodox way, <eob> using only <eol> 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, in the future and even right now, some very simple, white <eob> light <eol> photographs from the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that we are poised <eol> to enter an era where artificial intelligence <eol> is going to make an incredible impact on our future. <eol>
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eol> which is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we should also continue thinking <eol> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data <eol> and solve some <eob> of the most important <eol> problems facing us <eob> today, especially in health care. <eol>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill <eob> or a vaccine <eob> and, just like getting over a <eob> cold, <eob> you could heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, <eob> if we have <eob> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give us <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
Just like <eob> vaccines instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues <eob> and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, <eol> regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eob> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can <eob> regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander can completely regenerate <eol> their arm, and even <eol> us mere humans <eob> can regrow our liver after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm <eob> investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eol> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eob> to that annoying sinus infection, <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our body from <eob> danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, and <eob> by using what I know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eol> I was able to identify <eob> key players <eob> in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When <eob> looking <eob> at materials <eol> that are <eob> currently being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured muscle with these materials, <eob> there was a large number of immune cells <eob> in that material <eol> and the <eol> surrounding muscle.
So in this case, instead of the immune cells rushing off <eol> towards infection to fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T cell, was present inside <eol> that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound <eol> healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eob> and try and tape it back together again, <eol> we can heal, <eob> but it might not be <eol> in the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't <eob> have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eol>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eol> without these scars <eob> and look like what it was before we were even injured.
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eol> to build new <eob> tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that any time <eob> a material is <eol> implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers are using <eol> to try and build new tissue. <eob>
So <eol> when I place that material, <eol> or scaffold, in the body, <eol> the immune system creates <eol> a small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the way that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the <eol> weather <eol> affects our daily activities, like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eob> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eol> from <eol> plastics to naturally derived materials, <eol> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more or less porous, <eob> gels of <eob> different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed for different tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors".
I'm combining specific types of signals <eob> that mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow <eob> and be able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not <eob> next Tuesday, either. <eol>
But with these advances, <eob> and working <eol> with our immune system <eol> to help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, as a child, <eob> I used to <eol> spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, <eol> summer days, I would dash across the floor <eob> and stick my face in front of <eol> her <eob> only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door <eob> neighbors having to set up <eol> fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me.
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eol> comfortable for <eob> one more day. <eob>
These kinds of dangerous <eol> incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced with impossible choices. <eol>
In the US, the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, even 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy.
In 2015, this caused over <eol> 25 million people to <eob> skip <eob> meals <eob> to provide power to <eol> their homes.
This is when energy becomes a burden.
But energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you <eob> take your child <eol> to get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you <eob> feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible choice, and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eob> between medicine and energy.
This exposes a much larger <eol> and systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eob> are disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more <eob> per <eob> square foot <eol> than their white counterparts. <eob>
But <eob> it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable <eol> to afford energy <eob> for their most basic needs. <eol>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eol> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma.
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eob> we <eob> have the tools to address <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we approach cost <eol> parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when I was 22, <eob> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities, <eob> utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eol> of local communities, in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships.
So we start by working directly with the communities <eol> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities to learn about energy poverty, <eol> and how making even small updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency.
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to community solar <eol> and spearheading community-led <eob> smart home research <eol> and installation programs <eol> to help families bring down their energy bills. <eol>
We're even working directly <eob> with elected <eob> officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eol> because to see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US spends over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do <eob> help <eol> millions of people, but <eol> they're only able to help <eol> a fraction <eob> of those in need. <eob>
In fact, <eob> there is <eol> a 47-billion-dollar <eob> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not sustainable. <eob>
But by building <eob> energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eol> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy that is clean, reliable and affordable. <eol>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of <eob> their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make ends meet. <eob>
This is life-changing.
This is an opportunity <eol> for families to use their energy savings <eob> to sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back <eol> to my great-grandmother <eob> and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eol> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on our whole community. <eob>
But <eob> this is not just about them. <eol>
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible choices today.
And I know high energy burdens <eol> are a <eob> tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will all be more resilient. <eol>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched a flock of birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating? <eol>
What I find remarkable is that these birds <eob> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have <eol> to follow one leader. <eol>
Their reaction speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eol> allowing every single bird <eol> to make autonomous <eob> decisions <eol> while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast <eob> and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eol> with any one of us? <eob>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the most important change <eob> that is <eob> needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster and more complex, so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way <eob> that creates alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers people to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was working with a bank that wanted to embark on a digital transformation.
They wanted their offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eob> have seen a bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate <eol> what many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking <eob> elevators to go <eob> to their department, marketers sitting with marketers, engineers with engineers, etc.
You <eob> see meetings with 20 people <eob> where <eol> nothing gets decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They end <eob> up <eob> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eol>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments.
Getting anything done can take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they <eob> would <eob> have to improve their <eob> time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how?
To get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to go and have a look at companies <eob> that seem <eob> to be more innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And I remember how we were walking the halls at one of these companies <eob> in December 2014, <eob> a management consultant <eol> and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt like strangers in a strange land, surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots of <eol> smart, creative employees.
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eob> And we expected <eol> to get an org <eob> chart. <eol>
But instead, they used strange drawings with funny names like "squads" and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to explain how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own <eob> world. <eol>
We asked, "How many people <eol> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for what we thought <eob> were some of the basic principles <eob> of <eob> organizations, <eob> and their answer was, <eol> "It depends". <eol>
Now, over the course of that day, <eob> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they <eob> could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently <eob> of others in the company. <eol>
They did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eol> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned.
And we had started to like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how <eol> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all <eob> day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see you like our model. <eol>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are you willing to give up?" <eob> What were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eob> but we knew he <eob> was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eol> it's about giving up <eol> on some of the old as well. <eol>
Now, over the past five years, <eol> I have worked with companies <eol> all <eob> over the world <eol> to change their ways of working.
And clearly, every company has their own skeptics <eol> about why this is not <eol> going to work for them.
"Our product is more complex," <eol> or "They don't have the legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't <eol> allow this <eol> in our industry". <eol>
But for this bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I have worked with <eob> afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we completely <eol> blew up the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eob> product, channels and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees were reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eol> a product person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same team. <eol>
You <eob> could be a member <eob> of a team <eob> responsible for account opening or for the mobile banking app, etc.
At the go-live date <eol> of that new organization, <eol> some people were shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eol> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 <eol> years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
But now, they're <eob> having coffee <eob> together every day. <eol>
If the <eol> product guy has an idea, he can just raise it to get input from the engineer <eol> who is sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, just <eob> getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting there is not easy. <eob>
And <eob> as it turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eol> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and down <eob> the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But <eob> to do so, we need all <eob> the skills <eol> and expertise for that decision <eob> in the team. <eol>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people who are working in different buildings, different cities or even <eol> different <eol> countries <eob> today? <eol>
Or should we invest <eol> in better <eol> videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do things <eol> across these teams? <eob>
We still need some kind <eob> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all <eol> these changes <eol> to structure <eob> and process and procedure -- <eob> they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eob> difficult thing <eol> to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let me try to <eob> illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> they have <eol> to be empowered and autonomous. <eol>
But this means we cannot have leaders commanding their people what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But it also means that each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal <eob> title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative.
Now obviously, we <eob> also cannot afford <eol> to have all these teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eol> just like a flock of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new behavior, <eob> there is giving up <eol> on something <eol> old as well. <eob>
Leaders have <eob> to make sure <eol> that everyone in the organization is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose <eob> -- the why -- <eol> and the overall <eol> priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go <eol> and trust their teams to make the right decisions <eol> on how to get there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you know how they say <eol> that information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing <eob> information may feel as if they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate openly and <eob> transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share the output <eol> of what they've done, <eob> transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eob> each member <eob> of the team gives an update <eob> of what <eol> they are working on individually. <eol>
Now, all <eob> this <eol> transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, <eob> because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eob> is transparent for everyone. <eol>
So, alignment is not easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eob> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eol> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eol> he needs to <eol> walk down to the team floors <eob> to attend one of their sessions.
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is radical change <eob> for someone who used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, <eob> this executive said, <eol> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many <eob> projects would run <eol> over <eob> time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
Now I have much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if needed". <eol>
And middle managers <eol> need to change as <eob> well. <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eob> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the old world, there was this idea of thinkers and doers. <eol>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other people, middle managers were expected to become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been telling <eol> other people <eob> what to <eob> do, <eol> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again.
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and <eob> some great people leave the company.
But the result is a new culture <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth it.
The companies that I worked with, they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times <eob> per year.
Now they have releases every few weeks, <eol> and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of <eob> these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eol>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the halls of a very large start-up. <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much better prepared to respond to change. <eob>
The world <eob> is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working.
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is not in structure <eol> or process or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eob> senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of those <eol> in the organization who embrace the change.
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up?
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A leader is steady, firm, <eol> decisive, unwavering. <eob>
Never let 'em <eol> see you sweat, <eol> always have an answer. <eob>
[The <eob> Way We Work] <eob> My name is Dan, I'm a partner at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's <eol> another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, the character I created on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought about my double life, <eol> I <eob> couldn't help but wonder ... <eob>
When your true self is a little nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to the office? <eob>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eob> I thought there was <eol> one way to be a leader: <eob> decisive and serious. <eob>
But that's not me.
So I'd put on basically <eol> office drag to fit <eol> the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in my hand motions. <eob>
I'm someone who gets <eol> really excited about things, <eob> so I'd temper that. <eol>
I had this <eob> little voice in my head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant".
I <eob> had one well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's great. <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eob> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016.
I dressed up <eob> as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eob> thinking my friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eol>
And then, things got crazy. <eol>
The post <eob> went viral, <eob> and at first it was pure fun. <eol>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about how happy it made them, <eob> how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I <eol> started to <eol> think, <eob> maybe this is the <eob> time to tell that <eol> little voice in my head to just shut up <eob> and <eol> let myself be me. <eob>
But then things got a little <eob> too big. <eob>
Carrie Dragshaw <eob> was everywhere -- <eol> In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eob> "What would my bosses think?
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eol> I thought I was going to have to <eob> get a different job.
But then, <eob> something happened, <eol> something small. <eol>
I got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me.
And it let me put <eol> that little, scared voice away <eob> and just be excited <eol> about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one person, <eob> sometimes all it takes is one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable.
And my coworkers started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, <eol> more playful with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eob> gave them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eob>
But it's done the opposite. <eob>
Two years in, I never could have imagined that this <eob> part of me would not <eol> just be embraced, but could actually help my career. <eol>
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, in an office where creativity is valued <eob> and I <eob> was already pretty established in my career when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't.
But all of this has taught me so much <eol> about just <eol> the importance <eol> of bringing your whole self to work. <eob>
And it's really challenged <eob> my own misperceptions about what it takes to be successful. <eob>
There's no one kind of way to <eob> be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding your strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a <eol> meeting was hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect leader mask.
Now, I can <eob> say, <eol> "Gosh, that was frustrating".
We can talk <eob> about challenges <eol> and struggles in an open way, <eob> rather than everybody pretending <eob> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work.
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to <eob> me, though, <eob> is that <eob> in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eol>
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> and all of our strange inner voices <eob> have a long way to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big difference between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a little <eob> late. <eob>
Personally, I'm taking <eol> all of this <eol> as a call to be the <eob> ally who, like my boss did for me, <eob> lets people know that it's OK to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> or have a disability <eol> or are deeply religious, <eob> see what it's like being your full self at work.
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eol>
The basic problem <eol> with working in an office <eob> is you're just not in control of your work environment. <eol>
[The Way We Work] Howdy, my name is Matt, <eol> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, <eob> the company behind WordPress.com, <eol> Jetpack and WooCommerce. <eol>
We're coming up on over 800 employees, <eol> and they live everywhere, <eob> from California to <eob> Alabama, Mississippi, <eol> to where I live in Texas. <eob>
They're also in 67 countries. <eob>
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eol>
Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a home base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, they are in new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eol>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't care where they are. <eol>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a <eob> conscious choice <eob> from the very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't use the <eob> word "remote," because it sets up the expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eob> and some aren't. <eol>
I use the word "distributed" to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eob> on an <eob> equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed <eol> workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to <eob> build a company. <eob>
The key is you have to <eol> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eol> many <eol> of the first 20 hires <eol> were people <eob> I'd never met in person.
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years.
I wanted to continue that for one simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eol> are equally distributed throughout <eol> the world. <eob> But opportunity is not.
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the same <eol> small pond or bay.
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of <eob> hiring someone who <eob> grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who lives, works, <eol> wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> They bring a <eob> different understanding of that culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eol>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go distributed, there's a desire to <eob> give people autonomy <eol> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a role <eol> where specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eob> the room should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and <eob> put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed workforce <eol> is ideal for a technology company.
But people often <eob> ask me, <eob> "This works great for y'all, <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eol> If you have an office, <eol> you can do a few things <eol> to build distributed capability. <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the <eob> moment, <eob> in <eob> the kitchen, in the hall. <eob>
But if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eob> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eol> and what you were thinking about.
This allows others to pick up <eob> where you left off.
It allows people in different <eol> time zones to interact, it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eol> people leaving and people joining.
Try to have as <eol> much communication as possible online. <eol>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new people to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools. <eob>
There are so <eob> many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how you work <eol> probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place <eob> 48 weeks out of the year <eob> and you might have <eob> three or four weeks apart. <eob>
We try <eob> to flip that: we <eol> come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is connecting people. <eob> We want to make sure everyone's aligned and on the <eol> same page, <eob> and they have a deeper connection <eob> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring together <eol> that <eol> understanding and <eob> empathy. <eob>
And the final <eob> practice: give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can put <eob> towards a co-working space <eol> or just to buy coffee, so they don't get kicked out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eob> decided to <eol> pool <eob> their stipends together <eob> and rented a workspace on a <eob> fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they can invest <eol> in getting the right chair, <eol> monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are distributed first.
In a decade or two, <eol> I predict that 90 percent of companies <eol> that are going <eob> to be changing the course of the world <eob> are going to function this way. <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eol> consider how you can tap into global talent, <eob> give people autonomy to live and work <eol> where they feel they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it <eob> is that you're creating together. <eob>
