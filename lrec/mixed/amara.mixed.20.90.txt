The <eol> # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women face xx Pakistan is very serious <eol> and # to sometimes deadly <eol>
This xxxx of harassment <eob> keeps women <eob> from accessing xxx <eob> internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression.

xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down <eol> with xxx rise new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is # also the birthplace <eol> of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eol>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eol>
xxxxxxx aspect is # where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked # to women and # their bodies; <eob> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> even <eob> kill <eol> them sometimes the name so-called "family honor"; where xxxxx # are left # <eol> to die <eob> right outside their houses <eol> for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol>
Let me say this very clearly: <eol> it's # xxx honor; <eol> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a small <eol> village <eol> in <eob> # Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education.
The # elders of # my family allow women <eol> to pursue # their <eob> higher education <eol> or xxxxx careers.
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family, my father # was # one who really supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of
But in xxx end, I knew <eob> it's either me xx them, <eob> chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and for a woman <eob> wouldn't <eob> allow me to own x mobile <eob> until x was married. <eol>
And even <eob> I <eol> was married, <eol> this tool # <eob> became a tool for my xxx surveillance. <eob>
xxxx I resisted this idea <eol> of surveilled my ex-husband, <eol> he really didn't approve # of this <eol> and threw me # out of # his house, along with <eob> my six-month-old <eob> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was # the time <eol> when I first <eob> asked myself, "Why? <eol>
are women not # allowed <eob> to enjoy the <eol> same equal rights enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx
While the law <eob> states x xxxxx has # the same <eol> equal to the # information, <eob> why is it always men <eob> -- # <eol> brothers, fathers and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So to take # a step, <eob> instead of # keep questioning <eob> these <eol> patriarchal <eob> and societal norms.
And I <eob> the Digital Rights <eob> Foundation in 2012 to the issues and # women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eol>
lobbying xxx free <eol> and safe internet <eol> xx convincing young women <eob> that to the safe xxxxxxxx is <eob> their <eol> fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my <eob> part <eol> in igniting # the spark <eol> to address # the questions that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With <eob> a xxxx in my heart, and to offer a solution to this xxxxxxx <eol> I started Pakistan's and <eob> the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December xxxx <eol> -- <eol> (Applause)
to extend my support to # the women who do xxx know who to turn to <eol> when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online.
I think of the women # who do not # have <eob> the necessary <eob> support <eob> to # deal with the mental trauma when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eol> and they go about daily <eol> xxxxxxxx that is <eol> x rape threat in their in-box. <eob>

(Applause) <eol>
at # critical moment. <eol>
Our leaders, <eob> of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # <eol> failing <eol>
Why? <eob>
In # some cases, # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eob> to <eob> the wrong objectives.
And this # is unacceptable. <eol>
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct these wrongs?
xxx are we # xxxxx <eob> to <eob> xxxxxx the right course? <eol>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've # chosen the right objectives <eol> and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of # them have
And today # # <eob> to share with xxx <eob> what # really makes x xxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> that's what's crucial, how xxx <eob> why <eob> they set <eol> meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right reasons. <eol>
Let's go back to # 1975. <eol>
Yep, this <eol> # <eob> # me. <eob>
I've got a xxx to learn, <eol> I'm a computer <eol> engineer, <eol> I've got <eol> long <eol> # hair, but # I'm # working under <eol> Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the <eob> # greatest manager <eob> of his or any # other era.
Andy was # a superb and also a teacher, <eol> and he said # to me, "John, it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most".
And so Andy # a system <eob> called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx
xx # kind of rolls off xxx tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxx it's <eob> all about excellent <eol>
So <eob> a classic video from the 1970s of Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eob> management by objective systems are the # <eol> objectives and the key results, <eob> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx key results have to be measured, <eol> but at the end you can # look <eol> and without any <eol> xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do <eob> # xxxxx # or did I not that?" <eob> No. Simple.
John Doerr: That's <eob> Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, or <eob> OKRs, <eol> are a # simple goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and <eol> they # <eob> work for organizations, <eol> they work teams, they even work for individuals. <eol>
are what want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how I'm going xx get that done.
Objectives. Key <eob> results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's the truth: <eol> xxxx <eol> of us are goals wrong, <eol> and most <eol> xx us <eol> are not setting goals <eol> at all. <eob>
A lot <eob> of <eob> organizations <eob> set objectives and # meet them. <eol>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose <eob> to xxxxxxx their teams. <eob>
So # xxx do you set <eol> these goals the xxxxx way? <eol>
First, must answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because truly transformational teams combine xxxxx ambitions to their # passion and to <eol> their # purpose, <eob> they <eob> develop <eob> a <eob> clear <eob> and compelling # sense of why. <eol>
x want to tell you # a story. <eob>
I work with a <eol> remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company <eol> called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded, <eol> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs <eob> of lots of workers # at <eol> large companies. <eol>
And then two <eob> years <eob> into the company's life, the government issued a <eob> proposal <eob> to build the xxxxx ever cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll # <eol> that Medicaid is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our # xxxxx our children <eol> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna the time was # just 15 people <eob> and this database had to be built in one year, and # they had a set of commitments xxxx they xxx to honor, <eol> and frankly, they weren't going to <eob> make <eol> very much money xx the project.
xxxx xxx a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it.
She jumped <eol> at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eol>
Why? <eol>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother <eol> # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And he was <eol> seven, <eol> he had his # xxxxx grand mal seizure <eol> at Disneyland.
He fell to the <eol> ground. <eol> He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants. <eol>
They came # to the # country <eol> xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, so it was up to Jini to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine <eob> # years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> xxx that company bid on, won <eob> and <eob> delivered on that xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxxxxx Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family <eob> from bankruptcy, and # today it <eob> provides for <eob> Kimong's health <eol> and <eol> for millions others. <eob>
Nuna is <eob> my love letter to <eob> Medicaid.
Every row of xxxx # a life <eol> whose story deserves with dignity.
JD: And Jini's <eob> story tells us that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, what <eob> we <eob> want to have accomplished. <eol>
And objectives are <eob> # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx are inspiring, <eob> and they're kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking.
You think # a rockstar <eob> would be unlikely user <eob> of Objectives and <eol> Key Results, but xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eol> to wage <eob> a global xxx <eob> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx <eol> and his ONE <eob> organization has xxxxxxx <eob> on two really xxxxxxxxx <eol> audacious objectives. <eob>
The # is xxxx <eol> relief <eob> for the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eol>
The next xxxxxxxxx access <eob> anti-HIV drugs. <eol>
Now, why are these good
xxxxx xx back to # our checklist. <eol>
Check. # Concrete? Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eol>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eol>
How passionate?
What actions does # your <eob> passion <eol> lead xxx to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find a rhyme # with the # head, then your passion means nothing. <eol>
# OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for risk, <eol> for trust, <eob> where failing not <eob> a fireable offense.
And when you have <eob> that sort <eol> xx structure and environment and the right people, magic # xx around the corner.
JD: I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx and magic is right around the # corner. <eob>
This <eob> is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, xxxx Bono the # whats # of # <eob> goal-setting. <eol>
Let's turn <eob> # attention the xxxxx
Remember, the hows the <eol> key results. That's how we meet our objectives.
And good results are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're <eob> aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx
They're <eol> measurable, and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eol> Larry # and Sergey. <eol>
Here they 24 years old in their garage.
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, <eol> not # quite.
What he really # said was, <eol> "We any other to manage this company, <eol> so it a go". (Laughter) <eol>
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement.
But every quarter <eob> since then, every <eob> Googler has # written down <eol> her objectives and her key
They've graded them, <eob> and they've xxxxxxxxx # them <eol> for everyone to
And these <eob> are not used for bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # set aside. <eob>
They're <eol> for a higher purpose, <eol> and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective which was to <eob> build the xxxx generation client platform <eol> for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> in other words, build xxx <eob> browser.
He was very xxxxxxxxxx <eob> about how # he chose his key results. <eob>
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser?
It could <eob> be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eol> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not. <eob>
So he this # one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eol> build the best browser. <eol>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the ante. <eol>
In first year, <eob> his # <eob> was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He less xxxx 10. <eol>
Second year, he raised <eob> the bar to 50 million.
He got to 37 million users.
xxxxxxxx better. <eol>
In the <eob> # third year, <eob> he upped the ante once xxxx <eol> to <eob> # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an xxxxxxxxxx marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, improved xxx technology, <eob> and kaboom!
He got 111 # million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this # story, xxx so much for the happy <eol> but it someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it year after year after year.
It's x perfect story for nerd me.
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eob> and hows of our <eob> ambitions. <eol>
really matters is # the xxx <eol> that xx pour xxxx <eob> those vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
are x silver # bullet. <eob>
They're not going to # a substitute a strong <eob> culture or for leadership, <eob> but # when those # fundamentals are # in place, they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eol>
I # want you # <eob> to # think <eol> about your life for a moment.
Do <eob> you # have the right metrics? <eol>
Take <eob> time to write # down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key <eol> results. <eob>
xx it today. <eol>
If # like some feedback on <eol> them, <eol> you # can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com.
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, <eob> of <eol> xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx <eob> affordable health care, high-quality for # everyone, <eol> ending global poverty, <eol> access to xxx the world's information. <eol>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered xxxxx by OKRs. <eol>
Now, <eob> I've been called the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading good gospel <eol> according # to <eol> Andy xxxxxx <eol> but I want you <eol> to <eol> join xx # in this <eob> # movement. <eob>
Let's <eob> fight what it is <eob> xxxx really # matters, <eol> because we <eob> can # take OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
# can take them to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to # our governments. <eob>
We can xxxx those # governments accountable.
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track if we can <eob> and do measure <eob> what really matters.
Thank <eob>

What is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
is a stereotype <eob> that <eob> history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people in countries, <eob> like mine, Russia, look at <eob> as something that was or determined xx leaders, <eob> and common people could xxx <eol> influence it in any way.
Many Russians today do not believe <eob> that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eob> or ever <eob> will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to the way <eol> history has xxxx framed to <eob> the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And this is true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two # <eob> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, the year xx the Russian Revolution.
x <eol> asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we built a # social network xxx dead people, named Project1917.com.
My # team and I created our software, <eol> digitized and <eob> uploaded all possible real <eol> diaries and letters written by more than <eol> 3,000 people <eob> 100 # years ago. <eob>
So any <eob> user of our website # xx application <eol> follow a feed <eol> xxx each <eol> day <eob> of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eol> like # <eol> xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova and <eol> others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like # <eol> you xxx me, <eol> not # demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists of their xxxxxxxxx # <eob> fears, weaknesses, <eob> not xxxx their "genius ideas".
xxx project <eob> was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx <eob> who used to think that our country <eol> has <eob> always <eob> been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eob> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eob> xxx xxx our destiny. <eol>
But we take a broader look, it's not that black and white. <eol>
1917 # led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx <eob> this # project, we <eol> see # that Russia could # have <eol> had <eob> a different history <eol> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eob> as # any other country could or still can. <eol>
Reading the <eob> posts xxxx 1917, you learn that xxxxxx <eol> was first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or one the first ones to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing <eob> # history and understanding <eol> xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eob> can help # us create a future, <eob> because history is xxxx a rehearsal <eol> of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eol>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this xxxxx for example, we started a # xxx online project <eol> that called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and <eob> that is an online documentary <eol> that gives <eol> you <eob> an impression of that xxxxx a year marked by global social change <eob> that, many ways, <eol> xxxxxxx the world as know it now. <eol>
But we are making xxxx history by imagining what if all # the main <eob> could use mobile phones # ... <eol> just like that? <eol>
And we see that x lot <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and were fighting the same <eob> values, no matter if they lived <eob> in the US or in <eob> USSR <eol> or France or in <eob> China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia.
By exposing history <eob> in such a democratic way, through <eol> # social media, we show <eol> that people xx power <eol> are not the only ones <eob> # making # xxxxxxxx
That gives # any user a possibility <eob> of reclaiming history. <eol>
people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eol>
Journalists, scientists, xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # matter.
We shape <eob>
We all make history. <eob>
you. <eob>
(Applause)
algorithms today are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at <eob> a massive scale, <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eol>
And <eol> this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eol> is often referred to xx AI <eol> or artificial # intelligence.
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eol> on our lives in the <eob> # future. <eob>
Today, # however, we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx in detecting and <eol> diagnosing <eol> several # life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious diseases xxx <eol> cancer. <eol>
xxxxxxxxx of every lose their # lives due to liver and # oral cancer.
Our xxxx way <eob> xx help these patients <eol> is to perform early detection <eob> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases. <eol>
So how <eob> xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eol>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected <eob> xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert <eob> physician xxxxx # orders <eol> very expensive <eob> medical xxxxxxx technologies such <eob> as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, CTs, <eol> MRIs, # to be performed. <eol>
Once those images are # <eob> collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those images <eob> and talks to the patient. <eob>
As <eol> you can see, this <eol> is <eob> a very process, <eol> requiring both expert physicians, <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies, and is considered practical <eob> for the # developing world. <eob>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well.
So, can # we this <eob> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to <eob> solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eol> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eob> these very expensive medical # <eol> first to be generated. <eol>
After that, I would then # # <eob> an # expert physician, who would then analyze <eob> those images for <eob>
And <eob> # using those two pieces xx information, I can train a standard deep neural network <eol> xx deep learning <eol> network <eol> to provide patient's <eol> # diagnosis. <eol>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, traditional # intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eob> xxx # expert medical imaging technologies. <eol>
So, can we invent more scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx artificial intelligence architectures <eol> to solve <eol> these very problems facing today? <eob>
And <eob> this is exactly <eol> what my group at MIT Media xxx does. <eob>
We have invented # a variety of <eob> unorthodox # AI architectures to solve some of the <eob> most # important challenges facing us today in medical imaging <eol> and <eob> clinical # trials. <eob>
In # the example I shared <eob> with you today, <eob> we had two goals. <eol>
Our first goal <eob> was to reduce xxx number of images <eol> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms.
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more ambitious, xx wanted to reduce the use <eob> of expensive medical imaging <eob> technologies to screen patients. <eob>
So how we # do it?
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and thousands <eol> of <eob> these very # expensive images, <eol> like <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we started a single medical image. <eob>
From this # <eol> image, my team and x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions of information # packets. <eol>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eol> and rendering xx the disease <eol> xx the medical image. <eol>
In x sense, we converted <eob> # one into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the # amount of data <eol> needed xxx training. <eob>
For our second xxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx the use expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients, <eol> we <eol> started with a standard, <eob> white light <eob> photograph, acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eob> billions of <eol> information # <eol> packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from xxx medical image onto this <eob> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image. <eol>
Much <eob> to our <eob> we only required 50 -- <eol> I <eob> repeat, # xxxx # <eob> 50 # -- <eol> of composite images to train <eob> xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies.
To summarize <eob> xxx approach, <eol> instead of using <eob> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the AI <eol> in an # unorthodox way, <eol> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx but standard photographs, acquired <eob> from DSLR cameras <eol> xxx <eob> xxxxxx phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, our algorithms <eob> can # accept, <eob> in the future and even right now, <eob> some # very simple, # white light <eob> photographs from <eol> patient, <eol> of # <eob> expensive <eob> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx
I believe that <eob> we are # poised <eol> to enter an # where artificial # intelligence is to make an xxxxxxxxxx <eob> impact # on our xxxxxxx <eol>
I think that xxxxxxxx about traditional AI, <eob> which data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue # thinking about unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept # small xxxxxxx # of data <eob> and solve some of the most important xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx especially <eob> in xxxxxx # care.
Thank you very much. <eol>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, like getting # over a cold, you could your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, <eob> xx we have an operation or <eob> # xx accident, <eob> we're in the <eob> hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side <eob> effects of our regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I <eol> xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx give the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease, we <eob> could instead instruct <eol> our immune system to build tissues <eol> and quickly heal wounds. <eol>
Now, regrowing <eob> body parts out of nowhere might seem like magic, <eob> but there are <eob> several # organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eol> and # even <eol> us mere <eol> can # regrow our liver <eob> after losing more <eob> than half <eob> of its original mass. <eob>
To make xxxx magic a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eob> can wounds # and build <eob> # tissue <eol> through instructions <eob> from the immune system.
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eob> xxx immune system defends <eob> our # body from danger. <eol>
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eol> I was able to key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eob> xxx <eob> cuts and bruises. <eol>
xxxx looking at materials that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eol> our <eob> team noticed that after treating <eob> an injured xxxx these materials, xxxxx was a large number of immune xxxxx <eol> in xxxx material and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
xx in this case, <eol> instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off <eol> towards infection fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward # an injury. <eol>
I discovered a specific <eob> type of xxxxxx <eol> cell, the helper T <eob> cell, <eol> was present inside <eob> material that I implanted xxx absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just like when you were x kid <eol> and <eob> # you'd break your pencil <eol> try # and tape <eob> it back together again, <eob> can # heal, <eob> but # it might <eol> not be # the most functional way, and we'll xxx a <eob> scar. <eol>
So if # we xxxxx have these <eob> helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops <eob> fat # cells inside of it, <eol> and if there's fat in our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx <eol> as # strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eol> without these scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eob> before we were even injured.
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> xx changing the immune
We know that any time <eob> a material # implanted in our # body, <eob> the <eol> immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eol>
This ranges xxxx pacemakers to insulin # pumps <eol> to the # materials # that <eob> engineers are using xx <eob> try and new <eob>
xx when # I xxxxx that material, <eol> or # scaffold, in body, <eob> the immune creates <eob> small environment cells and proteins <eob> that change the xxx that our stem cells behave. <eob>
just like the # weather <eob> affects our # daily activities, like # going for a run <eol> or <eob> staying and <eol> entire TV show # Netflix, immune of a scaffold <eob> affects the <eob> way that <eob> our stem cells grow and develop. <eol>
If we have the wrong signals, <eol> say the signals, we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eol>
These scaffolds # are <eob> of a different things, <eol> plastics <eob> to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx sponges that <eob> are or less porous, gels <eob> of stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different <eol> signals <eob> time.
xx other # words, we can <eob> orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed # different <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus "Little <eol> Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of <eob> signals <eob> that mimic # how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eol>
In # the <eob> future, # we see a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx a # <eob> muscle <eob> filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we aren't going to xxxx up tomorrow <eob> and be able <eob> xx heal # like Wolverine.
Probably <eol> next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, and # working with our immune system <eob> to build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could <eob> begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eol> that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate, <eol> and maybe one day be able <eol> xx keep pace with a salamander.
Thank you.

as a child, I used spend <eob> all <eol> of <eol> at my great-grandmother's house.
On hot, humid, days, <eob> x <eol> would dash xxxxxx # floor xxx stick my face in # front of her only air conditioner.
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eol> though # was a privileged <eob> one in # our community. <eob>
Growing up, <eob> stories of <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me. <eob>
During # the winter, struggling to get warm, my neighbors would have no choice <eol> xx bypass the meter after their heat shut off, xxxx to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day.
xxxxx of dangerous incidents xxx take root <eob> when people # are faced <eob> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eob> three percent of their income on <eob> # energy. <eol>
In # contrast, # low-income and xxxxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # spend 20, 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over <eob> 25 million people to skip meals to provide # power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden.
But energy burdens are xx much more than just a number. <eob>
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eol> Do # you take child <eob> get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her?
Or do you keep warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eol> and nearly every month, <eol> seven million people choose between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eob> and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high # energy burdens <eob> are disproportionately people of color, <eol> who spend <eob> more per square foot <eol> than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, <eol> and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall # into <eob> the mass <eol> of <eol> xx million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford <eob> energy <eob> for their most needs. <eol>
As a result, <eol> those xxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> energy burdens <eol> have a <eol> greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma. <eol>
Look -- # <eob> given rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized # <eob> we have the <eol> xxxxx <eob> to address <eob> these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is
Cost xx renewables, insulation, microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing. <eol>
even as <eol> we approach cost xxxxxxx the <eob> majority of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn much more <eob> than the average American. <eob>
This is why, <eol> # when I was 22, <eob> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eol>
Our mission is <eol> to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by # with # communities, utilities and # government agencies alike <eol> to provide <eob> equitable access <eob> to <eol> clean <eob> energy, <eol> energy efficiency and energy technology.
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe the power <eol> of local # communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eob> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eol> xxxx have the highest energy burdens.
We host workshops and events for communities <eob> to <eol> learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eol> and making even small updates to their homes like better insulation windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go <eol> a long way to maximize efficiency.
We're connecting # <eol> xx community solar <eob> and xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation # programs <eob> to help families their # bills. <eob>
We're even working # xxxxxxxx <eol> with xxxxxxx officials, advocating <eob> for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to <eob> see this vision <eol> of energy equity # and resilience <eob> succeed, <eol> we xxxx <eob> to # work <eob> together sustainably. <eob>
Now, xxx # US spends over three billion a year on energy bill payment assistance.
And these programs do help millions <eol> xx people, <eob> but they're # only able to help <eob> fraction of # <eol> those in need. <eob>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is <eob> not <eol>
But by building energy equity <eol> and # resilience into our communities, we can <eol> assure fair and impartial access <eol> to that is clean, <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eol>
At scale, # microgrid <eol> technology, <eob> clean technology and efficiency dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eol>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, <eob> it xxx help them <eob> reclaim <eob> 20 # their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a # person's income <eol> who's <eob> struggling # <eob> to make ends <eob> meet. <eob>
This is # life-changing. <eol>
This <eob> is an opportunity xxx families # xx use their # savings <eol> to xxxxxxx their future. <eol>
I think back <eob> to my <eol> great-grandmother and xxx neighbors, <eob> the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # to make and xxx <eob> # <eob> effect # our <eol> whole <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But this # is not just about <eob> # them. <eol>
There # are xxxxxxxx nationwide having <eob> to make <eob> the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eol> xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but # through relationships <eol> with communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will <eob> # all be more resilient.
Thank you. <eob>

Have <eob> ever <eol> a flock of birds work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that <eob> if they # all would have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed <eob> would simply be <eol> too low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these birds are aligned on <eol> x few simple rules, <eol> allowing every single bird to make autonomous decisions <eol> while still flying in perfect synchrony.
alignment enables their autonomy, and their autonomy <eob> xxxxx them xxxx and <eob> flexible.
xxxx what does this have to do with any one of # us? <eol>
Well, it's one # of xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change that is needed in ways of working # today.
The world getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eol> so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx <eob> a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that truly empowers people <eob> to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give xxx
few years ago, # I was working with <eol> a <eob> wanted <eol> to embark <eob> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They # wanted <eob> # xxxxx offering to <eob> be simpler, <eol> intuitive, xxxx relevant.
Now, I'm not sure how many you <eol> have seen a bank from the # inside, so # let me try to <eol> illustrate <eol> xxxx many traditional banks look like.
You see lots of people in <eob> suits taking elevators to go <eol> to their # department, <eol> marketers # <eob> sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, <eob> etc.
You see meetings with xx people where nothing gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end <eob> up <eol> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx <eob>
And there are endless <eol> handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
anything # done xxx take forever. <eol>
So this bank knew <eol> that <eol> in order to # transform, <eol> they would have to improve <eol> # to market <eob> by drastically xxxxxxxx <eol> their ways <eob> xx as well.
xxx how? <eol>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to # go and have a look <eol> at # companies <eob> # seem to be more innovative, <eob> xxxx Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And I remember # how we <eob> xxxx walking <eob> the <eob> xxxxx at <eol> one of these <eob> companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> x management consultant <eob> and a xxxx of # bankers.
felt like strangers xx a strange <eol> land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags <eob> and hoodies <eol> and lots # of # xxxxxx creative employees.
So then we asked, <eol> "How is <eob> your company organized?" we <eob> expected xx # get an org chart.
But instead, they used strange drawings funny names like # "squads" and "chapters" and "tribes" <eol> # explain they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to xxxxxxxxx <eol> that to our # own world. <eol>
We asked, "How people are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides your priorities?" "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eol>
We were # asking # for what we thought were some # of the basic principles <eob> of <eob> organizations, <eol> and <eob> their answer xxxx "It depends".
Now, over the course of that xxxx <eob> xx gained a better xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their model. <eol>
They believed in # power of small, teams.
Their <eob> teams were like mini-start-ups.
xxxx had product people <eob> and # IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, <eol> # build <eob> and test ideas <eol> with customers <eol> independently of # others in the # company.
They did not need handovers <eob> xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had <eol> all the skills needed right there # in the team.
Now, at # the <eob> end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eob> to reflect xx what we had learned. <eob>
And <eob> xx had started to like their model, xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # bank.
But xxxxx # one of the hosts, a guy who <eob> had not said a word all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eol> "So I see like our <eol> # model. <eob>
But # I have one question for you: What # are willing to give up?" What were we willing to give up?
We did not have xx answer immediately, <eol> but <eob> we knew he was right. <eol>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; it's about giving up <eob> on some # of the <eol> old as # <eol>
Now, over the past five <eol> years, I # have # worked with companies all <eol> over the world <eol> to <eol> change their xxxx # of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company xxx their # own skeptics about why <eob> this not going work # xxx <eob> them. <eol>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> xx "They # have <eol> the # legacy IT like we xxxx <eol> or "Regulators # just won't <eob> this in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank and also <eob> for <eob> the other companies that I worked with afterwards, <eol> change was possible.
Within a year, we # completely <eob> blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eob> xxxxxxxx channels and IT.
Three # employees xxxx # <eol> into # 350 teams. <eob>
So instead xx product people sitting just with product # people <eob> and engineers with engineers, a # <eob> product # person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same <eol>
You could be a member of a team responsible <eol> for account opening <eol> or the mobile banking app, etc. <eol>
At the go-live date <eob> that <eol> # new organization, <eob> some people xxxxxxx hands for the very first time, <eob> to # find out that they # had been sitting two # away from each other <eol> but they xxxx sending each # other emails and status reports for the last 10 # <eob> years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy # that # I <eob> was always chasing xxx <eol> answers". <eol> <eob>
But they're <eol> every day. <eol>
xx the product guy xxx an idea, <eob> xx can just raise <eol> to get input <eob> the engineer xxx sitting right next # to # him.
They can to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red <eob> xxxxx <eob> xxxx getting # xxxxx # done.
Now, getting there is # not # easy. <eob>
xxx # as it turns out, <eob> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the # right question to <eob> ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
of decisions up and down the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide. <eol>
But to xx so, we need all the # and expertise <eob> for that # decision <eob> in the team.
And this brings difficult <eob> trade-offs.
Can we physically co-locate our people <eob> are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or <eob> different countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing?
And how do we ensure consistency in the way # we do things across these <eob>
We still some kind <eol> of management <eob>
Now, all these changes structure <eob> process and procedure -- xxxx # are not
in the end, <eol> I found that the # most <eol> difficult thing to <eol> change <eol> xx <eob> our own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Let me # try to illustrate.
we # want these teams to be fast, <eob> flexible, creative, like a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eol> when # to do, how to do. <eob>
No <eob> micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that each xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # title. <eol>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eol>
Now # obviously, we also # cannot afford <eob> to have # all teams <eob> running in different directions, <eob> xxxxxxx that would <eob> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eol> just a flock of <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eol> requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new <eol> behavior, <eol> there # is giving up on something old as well. <eol>
Leaders have <eol> to <eob> # make sure <eob> xxxx # everyone in the organization <eol> is aligned around <eob> the overall -- # the why -- <eob> overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
then they have to let # go <eol> and trust # their # teams <eol> to <eol> make the right decisions <eol> on <eol> how to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you how they say that information # is a source of <eob> power?
Well, for some managers, sharing information <eob> may # feel as <eob> they're giving up that source of power. <eol>
it's not just managers. <eol>
xxx teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx teams <eob> typically work <eob> # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # end of every sprint, they organize a demo session <eob> share the output what they've transparently.
And every <eob> each <eob> # <eol> member of the gives # an <eol> update of what they are # working on individually.
Now, all this transparency can xx uncomfortable people, because there xx <eol> no place to <eob> # hide anymore.
Everything we do <eob> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone.
So, <eob> # is not easy, <eob> providing autonomy <eol> not xx obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain xxx he <eob> used to be a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, # today, to <eol> know how things # are # going, instead of looking at reports, <eob> he needs to walk down the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help them. <eol>
That is xxxxxxx change <eob> for someone who used <eob> to xx <eol> a master <eob> of <eob>
But in the xxx world, this executive # said, "I only <eob> had the illusion xx control.
In reality, many projects would over time and xxxx budget, <eol> anyway.
Now I have xxxx more and # I can course-correct <eob> much if needed".
And middle need to change as well. <eob>
First <eol> xx all, without the handovers <eob> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx <eol> for middle <eol> managers. <eol>
And <eob> in the world, there was idea of thinkers # and doers. <eol>
Employees would just follow orders.
But now, instead of # only <eob> xxxxx people, <eob> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches. <eob>
So <eol> imagine, for the 10 <eol> you have # just been telling xxxxxx what to do, <eob> but now # you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model <eob> is not for everyone, and some great leave the xxxxxxxx <eol>
But the <eol> result is # a new xxxxxxx with less <eol> hierarchy. <eob>
And <eol> xxx this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth <eol>
The that I worked # with, they were used to deploying <eol> new product a few times per year. <eol>
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, and without the handovers and <eol> the red tape, the whole # organization <eol> becomes more <eol> efficient.
And <eob> if walk the halls <eol> xx these companies today, <eol> you just a <eol> # energy. <eob>
It feels <eob> as if you're walking <eob> the of a very xxxxx # start-up.
Now, be fair, these companies, they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet.
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much <eob> better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx so we need reboot our way of <eob> working. <eob>
And the hardest of that <eob> is not in structure <eob> or xxxxxxx or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just senior # executives xxxxxx charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all <eob> of <eol> in the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eol>
xx all <eob> # have xx lead change. <eob>
So the question is: What are willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eol>

[The Way Work] <eol> My is Dan, I'm x partner at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But <eob> there's another <eob> side to # me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character <eob> I created on Instagram. <eol>
As <eob> I thought about my double life, <eol> I couldn't help but <eol> wonder ...
When your true # self is # a little nontraditional, <eol> how # <eob> of it can really <eol> bring to the office? <eob>
For <eob> some of us # is <eol> authenticity
xxx the xxxxx of my career, <eol> I thought there was <eob> one xxx # to <eob> be a leader: <eol> decisive and # serious. <eol>
But xxxxxx not me. <eob>
So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role: <eol> I'd # talk # xx x deeper voice, <eol> to <eob> hold in my # hand <eob> motions. <eob>
I'm someone who gets really excited about things, <eol> so I'd temper that. <eob>
I had this little <eol> in # my head, telling xxx <eob> too gay, <eob> too feminine, # too flamboyant". <eol>
I had one adviser who xxxxx <eol> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's great. <eob>
you xxxxx need to beat <eob> them <eob> xxxx the head <eob> with it". <eob>
to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
dressed # up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, <eob> Carrie Bradshaw, <eol> my friends <eol> would get <eob> a kick <eob> out # xx <eob> it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eol>
The went viral, <eob> xxx at xxxxx it was pure xxxx <eob>
I started <eob> getting <eob> these incredible <eob> messages from people about how happy it made them, <eob> how encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic <eol> selves. <eob>
And I started to think, maybe this is the time to tell that <eol> little in my # head to just xxxx up <eol> let # myself be me. <eol>
But then things got <eob> a little # <eob> too big. <eol>
Carrie Dragshaw was xxxxxxxxxx xx <eob> In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eob> and <eob> I got terrified: <eol> "What # would my bosses <eol>
xxxxx # my coworkers still xxxxxxx me xx a leader?
What would <eob> my <eol> clients think?" I # thought was going to have <eob> to <eol> a different job. <eol>
But then, something happened, <eol> something small. <eol>
I got a text from my boss, it wasn't long, just said, <eol> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eol> With # <eob> a xxxx xx xx <eob> article that had just gone about me. <eob>
And it let me put little, scared voice away and just be <eol> excited <eol> this whole # world, rather xxxx freaked out. <eob>
xxxxxx the # xxxxx # of one person, sometimes all it takes is xxxx <eol> to you feel xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And my # coworkers started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, more playful xxxx me, <eob> it <eob> was xx if # knowing this other # side of me gave them permission <eob> to # be <eol> more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that # <eol> openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eob>
But done the xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Two years in, <eob> never could have imagined that <eob> # this xxxx would not just be # embraced, <eob> but actually help my career. <eol>
Now, I'm lucky. <eol>
I work in New York City, <eob> in xx # office where creativity is <eol> valued and I was already pretty <eob> established in my career all <eob> of <eol> this <eob> started.
Maybe that's you, maybe xx isn't. <eob>
But all xx this has taught me so much about just the importance <eob> of bringing your whole # self to xxxxx <eol>
And it's really challenged my <eol> own misperceptions about what xx # <eob> to be xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
There's no one kind of way <eob> # be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eob> xxx <eob> finding ways to amplify <eol>
Before, if meeting was hard, I'd xxx on my perfect mask. <eob>

It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> from the very <eob> beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't <eob> the word <eol> "remote," <eol> because it sets up the <eol> expectation, <eol> that some people <eob> are <eob> essential and some <eol> aren't. <eol>
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eob> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on # an playing field. <eol>
I think a distributed # workforce <eol> is the most effective way <eob> xx build a # company.
The xxx is you have to <eol> approach <eob> it consciously.
When <eob> we started WordPress, <eol> many the # first <eob> 20 hires <eob> were xxxxxx I'd <eob> never met in person.
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eol> are equally distributed <eol> throughout <eob> the world. But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the tech # companies fish from essentially the same small pond or # bay. <eob>
x distributed xxxxxxx can fish from xxx entire ocean.
Instead of hiring someone # grew <eob> up <eol> in <eob> Japan but lives in <eob> you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, wakes up and # goes to <eob> sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> xxxx bring a different <eol> understanding of culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eol>
At the base <eob> of <eob> to go distributed, <eol> xxxxxxx a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over xxx they # do their <eob> work. <eob>
Unless you're <eob> in a <eob> role <eob> where hours are important, you # can # your own schedule. <eol>
Everyone can have corner office, <eol> their windows, <eol> the # food <eol> they want to eat, <eob> you <eob> can choose when there's music <eob> and when there's <eob> silence. <eol>
You xxx what temperature <eob> the room should <eob> be.
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into things <eob> that are <eol> important to you.
A distributed # <eol> workforce xx xxxxx for x technology company. <eob>
But people often me, <eol> works <eol> great for xxxxxx but what about everyone else?" If you # have an office, you do a things <eol> to build xxxxxxxxxxx capability.
First: xxxxxxxx everything.
In an office, it's easy <eob> to make decisions in # <eob> moment, <eob> in # <eol> the kitchen, # the <eol>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team <eol> are having conversations <eol> don't have <eob> xxxxxxx see <eol> these decisions made <eob> without <eob> understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail where you were <eob> and what # you were thinking about.
This allows <eol> others to # pick up <eol> where you left off.
It <eob> allows in <eol> # time zones to interact, it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eob> people and xxxxxx
Try to have # much # communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> xx <eob> # allows # new <eol> people to catch up <eol>
You also <eob> need to find the tools.
There are so many apps and services <eol> that <eol> help with day-to-day <eob> video conferencing, project <eol> management.
The things that changed how you probably # aren't objects anymore. <eol>
xxxxxx you access through <eob> your computer. <eol>
So experiment xxxx different <eob> tools that enable <eol> see what xxxxxx <eob>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In <eob> a traditional office, you're in the same place <eol> weeks out of xxx <eol> year and you might have <eob> three or four weeks <eob>
We xxx to that: we come # <eob> together <eob> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eol> comes together <eob> a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eol> We # want to make # sure everyone's <eob> aligned and on same page, <eol> and they have a deeper with their colleagues. <eob>
When they xxxx together <eob> the rest of the year, <eol> they can <eob> bring xxxxxxxx that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And # the final <eob> practice: <eob> give people the to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eob> has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx they can put <eol> towards a co-working space or just to buy coffee, so <eob> don't get kicked out # of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group <eol> in Seattle <eol> decided <eob> pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a workspace on <eob> a pier.
Each <eol> xxxxxx who the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eol>
This is # money they can invest <eol> xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, the right desk setup, so can have the most productive environment for them. <eol>
Today, there are just a few companies that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or <eob> xxxx I predict # that # 90 # percent of companies <eol> that <eob> are going to be <eol> the course of the # world <eol> are going to function this <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced by those that are.
As you think xxxxx <eol> xxxx you're going to build next, <eol> consider <eol> how you can tap <eol> into global xxxxxxx <eob> give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eob> xxxxx # they feel they xxxxxx <eol> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eob> it is <eol> that you're creating <eob> together. <eob>
