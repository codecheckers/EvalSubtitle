I <eol> # work with x remarkable # <eol>
xxx name is # Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eol>
xxxx is # health care <eob>
And # xxxx Nuna <eob> # founded, they # used data to serve xxx health xxxxx <eol> xx xxxx of workers xx large <eol>
xxx <eob> then years <eol> into xxx # life, <eob> the issued a proposal <eol> to build the # first # ever <eol> cloud database for # Medicaid. <eol>
Now, you'll remember <eol> xxxx # Medicaid # xx # program serves xx # million # Americans, <eol> our poor, # <eob> our children <eob> and # disabilities. <eol>
Nuna <eob> at the # time was xxxx people <eob> xxx this database <eol> to built in year, <eob> they xxx a whole set <eol> of <eob> that had to # honor, <eob> and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eol> very much <eob> the xxxxxxxx <eol>
This was x # bet-your-company # moment, <eob> and # Jini <eob> xxxxxx it.
xxxxxx # at # opportunity. <eol> She <eob> # did flinch.

Well, it's a xxxxxxxx why.
Jini's <eob> # younger brother <eol> Kimong # <eob> xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx when # he seven, <eol> xx had # first grand xxx xxxxxxx <eob> Disneyland. <eob>
He the ground. <eol> stopped breathing.
xxxxxx # parents are Korean <eob>

She was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
That xxxxxx defined # # xxxxxxxx <eol> and that mission became her xxxxxxxx <eob> # that company bid on, # won <eol> and on that # <eol>
Here's # to tell # you why.
xxxxxxx Jini <eob> Kim: Medicaid saved my xxxxxx from <eol> today # it provides for Kimong's health and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid. <eob>
Every row # of # data is a # life xxxxx story xxxxxxxx <eol> to be # told <eol> with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eol> that a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's # <eob> xx xxxx to xxxx # <eob> accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eol> xxxx # are inspiring, <eob> xxx # they're # x of vaccine against # # thinking.

The # first xx debt relief for the xxxxxxx countries the world. <eob>
# next xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> anti-HIV # drugs. <eol>
Now, # why xxx these good objectives? <eol>
Let's xx # back to our checklist.

Yes.
<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eob>

The OKR framework cultivates the <eob> the chemistry contained it. <eol>

What # is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners.
There is # <eob> x stereotype history <eob> should be focused on xxx # rulers, <eol> like Lenin Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, <eob> people in xxxx # # like <eol> mine, Russia, look # at xx something xxx # predetermined xx <eol> # determined by the <eob> leaders, and common people # xxxxx <eol> influence # any <eob>

xx # prove it, <eol> I spent years <eol> of my life xxxxxx <eob> to go xxx # years xxxxx <eob> to # the xxxx 1917, <eol> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

We # # all # those personalities <eol> being # like me, <eob> not demigods, <eol> and we # see that history xxxxxxxx <eol> # their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> not only their xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
project was # xxxxx xxx xxxx <eob> who xxxx to <eob> think that # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx <eob> # always been an empire <eob> and # <eol> ideas of freedom and democracy could # have <eob> just because democracy was xxx our destiny. <eol>
But # if # take xxxxxxx look, <eol> it's not that black and xxxxxx <eol>
1917 led # 70 years <eol> of communist xxxxxxxxxxxxx
But <eob> this project, # we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # <eob> history <eol> xxx # a # <eob> xx any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading # the posts 1917, you learn <eob> Russia <eol> was the # first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eob> or # xxx # of xxx first ones <eol> xx xxxxx # women voting # <eol>
Knowing history and # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> ordinary influenced # can # help us # x better xxxxxxx <eol> because history just a <eol> of what's happening xxxxx now. <eob>
xx do xxxx xxx # ways of telling # <eol> and this for example, <eob> we started # a xxx # online project <eol> xxxx <eob> is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> that # <eol> that gives an <eol> of <eob> that xxxxx xxxxx <eob> a xxxx # xxxxxx by xxxxxx social <eol> that, xx # many ways, <eol> created the as we know xx <eob>
But we are # that history alive by what xx all main <eol> characters use # mobile phones <eob> xxx <eob> just # like that? <eol>

By <eob> # exposing history in xxxx # a democratic # way, <eob> through xxxxxx media, <eob> we show xxxx people power are not xxx only # making choices. <eob>
That # gives any # user # a possibility <eol> <eol>

Today, however, we xxxxx # face # massive challenges <eob> in detecting and xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # illnesses, <eob> such # as infectious <eob> diseases and <eol> cancer. <eol>
Thousands of xxxxxxxx <eol> every xxxx <eob> lose their lives <eob> due xx # liver and # cancer.

So how do we detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx <eob>
xx # <eob> xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx # # diseases, <eol> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive <eob> xxxxxxx # imaging technologies as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # <eol> xxxxx to be xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then those images and talks to # the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is a very resource-intensive requiring xxxx # <eol> expert physicians, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and is xxx considered practical for xxx developing
And <eob> in fact, in # <eob> many <eob> industrialized <eob> # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> xx # solve this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eol> x <eob> repeat, on xx order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical xx # generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx # then go <eob> # expert physician, would xxxx <eob> those images xxx xxx
And those <eol> two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train xxxx neural network <eob> xx x xxxx learning network <eob> to provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis.
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eob> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eol> intelligence approaches xxxxxx from <eob> the same xxxxxxxx <eob>
Large of expert physicians <eol> xxx expert medical imaging # <eob>
So, # can we invent <eob> xxxx scalable, effective and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important problems # facing us xxxxxx
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my # group at MIT Media Lab does.
We have invented # a of AI # architectures <eob> to <eol> # solve some of the most important <eol> us today <eob> in xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials.
In xxxxxxx shared <eol> xxxx # you # had two goals. <eob>

# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we xxxxxx <eol> of # <eol> technologies <eol> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So <eol> how # xxx <eob> we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eol> instead of xxxxxxxx <eob> with tens xxx thousands <eob> xx these <eol> # # expensive medical xxxxxxx <eol> # traditional AI, <eob> we started # with # single medical image. <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, <eob> my team and x <eob> figured # a xxxx clever way <eol> xx # extract # billions <eol> of information
These # <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eob> on the <eol>
In a sense, # we <eob> converted # one xxxx billions <eol> of # training xxxx # points, massively reducing xxx amount <eob> of <eol> needed # for training. <eob>
our second to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies <eob> to <eob> xxxxxx patients, we started with a # standard, <eob> xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile # <eol> xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx <eol>
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- <eob> xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to <eob> xxxx efficiencies.
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of 10,000 <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train the AI algorithms <eol> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> using only 50 of <eol> # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> <eol> acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eol> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the and even <eol> some very simple, # white light photographs xxxx the patient, <eol> instead of expensive <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era <eol> xxxxx <eob> # intelligence <eob> is <eob> going xx make # incredible <eol> on our xxxxxxx <eol>

Instead, # scientists believe <eol> that these birds xxx aligned xx few simple rules, <eol> allowing <eob> # every # xxxxxx # bird <eol> # <eob> make decisions <eob> while flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
xxxxx alignment enables # their xxxxxxxxx <eol> and their autonomy <eob> makes # fast <eob> flexible. <eol>

xxxxx it's # # way illustrating <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> to xx the most change <eob> that is # <eob> # of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more complex, so # we need a xxx # way working, <eol> way that alignment around that <eol> takes xxx bureaucracy and that truly xxxxxxxx people <eob> xx make # decisions xxxxxxx <eob>
But the # <eob> is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, <eob> # I was working a bank that to embark <eol> on a transformation. <eob>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, <eol> more intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm # not sure how many of you <eol> have # # from # the # inside, <eob> so let me # try # to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eob>
# of # people xx xxxxx <eob> xxxxxx elevators go <eol> xx # their department, <eob> # marketers, <eob> engineers xxxx engineers, # <eob>
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
Great xxxx end up <eob> in # PowerPoint # parking lots. <eob>
And there are <eol> between <eob> departments. <eob>
Getting done forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew xxxx in # xxxxx to <eol> they would have # to improve their time to <eol> xxxxxx <eol> by drastically changing <eol> working xx <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> to <eob> xx and have # a look <eol> at <eob> xxxx seem to # more <eol> innovative, <eob> like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos. <eob>
I remember <eol> how we were walking <eol> halls at # xxx # of <eob> in 2014, <eol> a <eob> # management <eol> and a of bankers.
We felt # strangers in # land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx smart, # employees. <eob>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx <eol>
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange xxxx <eob> # names like xxxxxxxx and and "tribes" <eob> to <eol> # explain # <eol> how they xxxx organized. <eob>
So then we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working xxx you?" <eol> "It depends".
xxxx you report to?" "It <eol>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eol>
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that <eob> xx gained a # better <eol> understanding xx xxxxx model.
They believed the # <eol> of small, autonomous teams.
xxxxx teams like <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxx and IT <eol> engineers in the team <eol> so they could design, # build <eob> and test ideas with # customers <eob> independently of others the company. <eol>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
had all skills needed <eob> there <eol> xx the team.
Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eob> we # <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxxx on what xx <eob> had learned. <eob>
And # we <eol> xxx # started to # like <eob> xxxxx model, so # we # already # of how <eol> to # apply # # of these <eob> ideas # xx a bank. <eol>
But # then, # one of # # <eob> hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not # xxxx a word all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eol> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eol>
But I have for you: <eob> What are you willing to # give xxxx <eob> What were we willing xx give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not # only xxxxx <eob> embracing # the new; xxxx xxxxx giving xx <eol> on some the old as xxxxx <eob>
Now, xxxx xxx # xxxx # five # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx <eob> to change their ways # of # xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxx <eob> has # xxxxx # skeptics <eob> about # # xxxx xx not <eol> going to work # for them.
"Our product is # more complex," xx # "They xxxxx # have the legacy IT like # xx <eob> # xxxx <eol> # just won't # allow this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
xxx xxx bank and also <eol> xxx xxx other companies <eob> that I have worked <eol> with afterwards, <eob> was possible.
Within a # year, we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> product, <eob> channels xxx IT.
xxxxx thousand employees xxxx reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of # <eob> sitting with <eob> # <eol> people <eob> and # engineers engineers, a product xxxxxx xxx <eob> an <eob> engineer <eol> were now members of the same # xxxxx <eol>
You could be a member of # a <eol> xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, etc. <eob>
At xxx # date of <eob> that organization, <eob> people <eob> # xxxx # shaking <eol> # hands <eol> for the # # xxxxx time, only to xxxx out xxxx they xxx <eob> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other <eob> but # # were each <eob> # other emails <eol> and # status reports for the last 10 # <eob>
You # xxxxx # xxxx # xxxxxxx <eob> saying, <eob> xxxx # the # that I <eob> was always chasing # for # answers". <eob> (Laughter)
# xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eol> together every
If product an # idea, xx can raise xx <eob> get # <eol> xxxxx from the # engineer <eol> who # is sitting right next <eob> to xxxx <eol>
They can xxxxxx to # <eol> with customers immediately # <eob> no handovers, <eol> xx # PowerPoints, # no <eob> red <eob> just # getting xxxxx done. <eob>
Now, getting there # is # xxx easy.
xxx turns # out, <eol> "What xxx you <eob> # willing to # give xxxx <eob> is <eob> exactly # xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary <eol> # teams. <eob>
Instead xx <eob> # decisions going up and xxxx the organization, <eob> want the team to # decide. <eob>
But # to do so, we need all # the # skills <eob> and # expertise for # that decision <eob> in <eob> # team. <eob>
xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we physically co-locate <eob> # our xxxxxx <eol> who # are in # different different cities or even <eol> # countries today?
Or # should we in # better xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx # do we consistency <eob> in # way xx do <eob> across these teams?
xx # need xxxx kind <eob> matrix.
Now, # all changes to structure <eol> and process and # procedure -- <eob> they are # <eol>
But # xxx I # xxxxx that xxx xxxx difficult # xxxxx # to change xx our xxx behavior.
Let me xxx xx # illustrate. <eob>
If we # want these # teams <eob> to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eol>
# this means xx # cannot leaders commanding their people what # to xxx when # xx do, how to xxx <eob>
No micromanagers.
# it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eol> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eol> xx <eol> take <eol>
obviously, xx also xx have all # these teams <eob> # in different directions, xxxx <eob> certainly lead <eol> to chaos. <eob>
So we need <eob> alignment and autonomy <eol> at the # xxxx xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eol>
an xxxxxxxxxxxxxx setting, <eol> xxxx requires # behaviors, xxx xxxx each new xxxxxxxxx <eob> there xx giving up <eol> on something xxx as well.
Leaders have # make <eob> sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the <eob> is aligned <eol> xxxxxxx # # -- the xxx -- <eol> the xxxxxxxxxx # the what.
But then # they have to xxx # xx <eob> and trust <eol> their xx # make xxxxx <eob> decisions <eol> on xxx xx # get # there. <eol>
xxxx creating xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx # and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx you <eol> know how # <eob> information x xxxxxx of # power? <eob>
Well, # some managers, <eob> may feel xx if <eol> they're giving <eol> up xxxx source xx power. <eob>
# xxxx not xxxx <eob> # managers. <eob>
The teams need # xx <eob> communicate openly and # as # well. <eob>
xx # these xxxxxxxxxx the <eol> xxxxxxxxx in # short sprints, <eob> and # at # xxx # xxx # sprint, <eob> organize a demo # xxxxxxx <eob> to share the output <eol> of what # <eob> done, <eol>

Now, all # transparency <eol> uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> because suddenly, # <eob> there is place to hide anymore. <eob>

So, alignment xxx <eol> easy, and xxxxxxxxx # autonomy <eob> is so obvious, either. <eob>

Now I have xxxx transparency, <eol> xxx I can xxxxxxxxxxxxxx much <eol> earlier xx needed". <eob>
xxx middle to change as well. <eol>
First # <eob> all, without <eol> xxx handovers <eob> xxx # the xxxx of x need <eob> for managers. <eol>
And in <eob> the # old xxxxx # <eob> was <eol> # # of <eol> thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees # would just xxxxxx # orders. <eol>
But xxxx instead of <eol> other people, middle managers were expected <eol> to # player-coaches. <eol>
xx imagine, for the last xx # years, <eob> have # just been # telling <eol> other people # to do, now you're expected <eob> xx do <eob> things xxxxxxxx again.

# # is new # <eob> less <eob> hierarchy. <eob>
And all <eob> of this xx # work. <eob>
But # worth it. <eob>
The companies that I # <eol> with, <eol> they were used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> new product features # a few per # year. <eob>
they # have # releases every # few # weeks, and without the # handovers <eob> and the # xxx # tape, the # whole organization xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
finally, if you xxx # halls # companies today, <eol> xxx just <eob> feel # a xxx energy.

xxxx to be fair, these companies, <eob> they cannot # claim victory

Whether xxxx xxx in RVs <eol> xx traveling xxxxxxx they are xx <eob> places <eol> every # # <eob> week <eob> or month. <eol>
As long they # xxx # xxxx xxxx <eol> # care xxxxx they <eol>
Our distributed # work <eol> xxxxxx # xxxxxx accidentally.
xx was # x # # choice <eob> from the very xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I don't use xxx # <eob> word xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx it up expectation, <eob> that # people # <eob> xxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> and some aren't.
I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where # everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think # a workforce is the # most effective xxx <eob> to build x # company.
The key xx # <eol> you have to <eol> approach it # <eol>
When # xx started WordPress, <eol> many # of # the first 20 xxxxx were I'd never # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated <eob> online, <eob> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to <eol> # continue # that <eol> xxx simple reason.
I believe that # talent and intelligence are equally distributed # world. <eol> But opportunity # not. <eol>
In Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eol> from essentially <eol> the small # pond xxxx
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eol> can # fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone who grew # xx in Japan but lives in <eol> you # can gain # someone who lives, works, <eob> # up goes # sleep xxxxxxxx # they # are # the world. <eob> They xxxxx <eob> # a different <eol> understanding that culture <eob> and a # lived # <eol>
At xxx xxxx xx xxx decision <eol> to go # distributed, <eol> a desire # give people autonomy <eob> xxxx # # they xx xxxxx <eol> work. <eob>
you're a # <eol> where specific hours <eob> are you can make # your <eob> xxx schedule. <eol>
Everyone xxx have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want # eat, <eob> xxx # choose xxxx # music <eob> and # # <eob> # silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx what temperature <eob> the room xxxxxx <eob> # be. <eol>
You can save the xxxx <eob> you'd # spend # commuting <eob> and <eob> put it xxxx # things <eob> that are important to you.
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company. <eol>
But often ask me, <eol> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, about # everyone xxxxxx <eol> If you xxxx an office, xxx can do # # things <eol> to distributed capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In xx office, it's easy to xxxx decisions in the moment, the kitchen, in the <eob>
if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the <eob> are xxxxx they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these <eob> decisions being made <eol> understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave # of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about. <eob>
This # allows others # # pick up <eol> where left off. <eol>
allows people in different <eob> time zones to xxxxxxxxx <eob> also great to # think about <eol> as an organization <eob> people <eol> xxxxxxx and people joining. <eob>
Try # have # <eob> as much # communication <eol> possible xxxxxxx <eob>
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eol>
You need to xxxx the right tools. <eol>
are <eob> many xxxx and services <eol> that with # day-to-day communication, <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that # changed xxx you xxxx <eob> probably aren't <eob> # xxxxxxx # anymore.
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your # <eob>
So experiment with <eob> different <eob> xxxxx collaboration, <eol> see # what works.
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the # same <eol> place <eol> 48 # weeks # out of # <eob> the year <eol> and # might <eob> # or # four apart.
We flip that: <eol> we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. <eob> Once a year xx xxxxx <eob> # meet-up xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx for week. <eob>
It's <eob> half-work, half-play. <eol>
xxx goal is # people. # want <eob> to sure <eol> everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx <eol> and # have a # deeper connection <eob> with their <eob> colleagues. <eob>
When work # together <eob> rest of the year, <eob> they <eol> together that # understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the xxxxx practice: <eol> give people flexibility <eol> to make their xxx work environment. <eob>
Every person # a <eob> co-working # <eob> xxxx they can put <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> # a or # xxxx to buy coffee, so # xxxxx <eol> get <eob> kicked # out xx # xxx # coffee # <eob>
One in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their <eob> stipends together <eob> and rented a <eob> # xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing xxxxx <eob>
Each person who # # the company <eol> gets a <eob>
This is money they # can invest <eol> in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, <eob> xxx # desk so # xxxx have <eol> the most productive environment xxx them. <eob>
xxxxxx there # just a # few companies that are xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # xxxx <eob> I xxxxxxx that percent of companies <eob> are # # changing <eol> xxx course of the world <eol> are going <eob> # to # this # way. <eol>
They will # evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eol> they'll be replaced by those <eol> xxxx <eob>
As you # xxxxx about <eol> xxxxx to xxxxx next, <eol> consider how xxx can tap into # global talent, <eob> xxxx # people autonomy to live where they feel they # should participate # fully in whatever it is # xxxx you're creating <eob>
