xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx # Results, <eob> or # OKRs, <eol> are simple goal-setting <eol> # system <eob> and they # work for # organizations, <eol> they # work for teams, <eob> they even work for <eob>
xxx objectives are # xxxx <eol> you want <eob> xx have # accomplished. <eob>

xxxxxx xxx must answer <eob> xxx question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
xxxxx transformational # teams <eob> combine ambitions <eol> to their xxxxxxx to their xxxxxxxx <eob> and they # develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>
want # to tell # # a story. <eob>
I # <eob> work with x remarkable <eob> # <eob>
xxx name is # Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
xxxx is # health care <eob>
And # xxxx Nuna # founded, <eob> they # used data to serve xxx health xxxxx <eol> xx xxxx of workers xx large <eob>
xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, <eob> the issued a proposal <eob> to build the # first # ever cloud database for # Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> xxxx # Medicaid # xx # program <eob> serves xx # million # Americans, <eob> our poor, # our children <eob> and # disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the # time was xxxx people <eol> xxx this database <eol> to built in year, <eob> they xxx a whole set of <eol> that had to # honor, <eob> and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eol> very much the xxxxxxxx <eob>
This was <eob> x # bet-your-company # moment, <eol> and # Jini xxxxxx it. <eob>
xxxxxx # at # opportunity. <eol> She # did flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's # younger brother Kimong # xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx when # he seven, <eob> xx had # first grand xxx xxxxxxx <eob> Disneyland. <eob>
He the ground. <eol> stopped breathing. <eob>
xxxxxx # parents are Korean <eob>
xxxx came to # the # country <eol> with limited # resources <eob> speaking xxxxxx # English, <eol> so it was # up to Jini <eol> her family xxxxxxxxx <eob>
She was nine xxxxx <eob> xxxx <eob>
That xxxxxx defined # # xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became her xxxxxxxx <eob> # that company bid on, # won and on that # <eob>
Here's # to tell # you why. <eob>
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my xxxxxx from <eob> today # it provides for Kimong's health <eob> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid. <eob>
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx story xxxxxxxx to be # told with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eob> that a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's # <eol> xx xxxx to xxxx # accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eob> xxxx # are inspiring, <eol> xxx # they're # x of vaccine <eol> against # # thinking. <eob>
You think a # rockstar <eob> would # be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives Key Results, <eob> years, xxxx has used OKRs <eob> xx wage x global xxx <eol> against xxxxxxx and disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eol> focused # on two xxxxxx # gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first xx debt relief <eob> for the xxxxxxx countries the world. <eob>
# next xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> anti-HIV # drugs. <eob>
Now, # why xxx these good objectives? <eob>
Let's xx # back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? Check. Concrete? # Yes.
Yes. <eob>
<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
# does passion <eol> lead you to
If the heart # doesn't find <eol> x xxxxxxx rhyme # with # the head, <eol> your passion # means <eob>
The OKR framework cultivates the <eob> the chemistry contained it. <eob>
It gives us an environment for <eob> risk, <eob> trust, <eob> where xxxxxxx is not # fireable offense. <eob>
xxx when you # have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the people, <eob> magic xx <eol> around # the corner. <eob>
xxx # <eob>
OKRs cultivate xxx # madness, <eob> and xxxxx is right around the corner. <eob>

What # is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is # x stereotype history <eol> should be focused on xxx # rulers, <eob> like Lenin Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in xxxx # # like mine, Russia, <eob> look # at xx something <eol> xxx # predetermined xx # determined by the leaders, <eob> and common people # xxxxx <eol> influence # any <eob>
Many xxxxxxxx today do # believe <eol> xxxx Russia # could ever <eob> or <eol> # # will be # a truly democratic # nation, <eob> and xxxx xxx way <eol> history has been framed <eob> xx the xxxxxxxx # of Russia.
And this is xxx # true. <eob>
xx # prove it, I spent years <eol> of my life xxxxxx to go xxx # years xxxxx <eob> to # the xxxx 1917, <eob> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

last year, <eol> a social network for dead people, <eob> Project1917.com. <eob>
My team xxx x created # our <eob> digitized and <eob> uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries # xxx letters <eob> written # more # 3,000 <eob> 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user our website or application <eob> can follow x news feed <eol> for each day xx xxxx <eob> and # read xxxx <eol> like Stravinsky or <eob> Lenin xx Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx and <eob> felt. <eob>
We # # all # those personalities <eol> being # like me, <eol> not demigods, <eol> and we # see that history xxxxxxxx <eol> # their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> not only their xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
project was # xxxxx xxx xxxx <eob> who xxxx to think that # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # always been an empire <eob> and # ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could # have just because democracy <eol> was xxx our destiny. <eob>
But # if # take xxxxxxx look, <eob> it's not that black and xxxxxx <eob>
1917 led # 70 years of communist xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But <eob> this project, # we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eob> xxx # a # <eol> xx any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading # the posts 1917, <eol> you learn Russia <eol> was the # first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eob> or # xxx # of xxx first ones <eol> xx xxxxx # women voting # <eob>
Knowing history and # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> ordinary influenced # <eob> can # help us # x better xxxxxxx <eob> because history just a <eol> of what's happening xxxxx now. <eob>
xx do xxxx xxx # ways of telling # <eob> and this for example, <eob> we started # a xxx # online project <eol> xxxx is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> that # <eob> that gives an <eol> of that xxxxx xxxxx <eob> a xxxx # xxxxxx by xxxxxx social <eob> that, xx # many <eob> ways, <eol> created the as we know xx <eob>
But we are # that history alive <eob> by what xx all main characters <eob> use # mobile phones xxx <eob> just # like that? <eob>
And # xx # see xxxx a lot xx individuals <eob> xxxxxx the same challenges <eob> and were fighting for the xxxxxxx <eob> no # matter # if they xxxxx <eol> in xxx US # in # USSR <eob> or xxxxxx or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By # exposing history <eol> in xxxx # a democratic # way, <eob> through xxxxxx media, <eob> we show xxxx people power <eol> are not xxx only # making choices. <eob>
That # gives any <eob> # user # a possibility <eob> <eob>
xxxxxxxx # people # matter. <eob>

# poised make an # incredible impact <eol> on # lives # the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eol> we xxxxx # face # massive challenges <eob> in detecting and xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # illnesses, <eob> such # as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of xxxxxxxx every xxxx <eob> lose their lives <eol> due xx # liver and # cancer. <eob>
Our best way xx # help these patients <eob> is # # perform early <eol> and diagnoses xxxxx <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx # # diseases, <eob> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive <eol> xxxxxxx # imaging technologies <eob> as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx to be xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images and talks to # the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eol> a very resource-intensive <eol> requiring xxxx # expert physicians, <eol> xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and is xxx considered practical <eol> for xxx developing <eob>
And in fact, in # many <eol> industrialized # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eol> xx # solve this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eob> x repeat, on xx order # of <eol> 10,000 <eol> of these very medical <eob> xx # generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx # then go <eol> # expert physician, <eob> would xxxx <eol> those images xxx xxx <eob>
And those two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train <eol> xxxx neural network <eol> xx x xxxx learning network <eob> to provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eob> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same xxxxxxxx <eob>
Large of expert physicians <eol> xxx expert medical imaging # <eob>
So, # can we invent xxxx scalable, effective <eob> and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important <eol> problems # facing us xxxxxx <eob>
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented # a <eol> of AI # architectures <eob> to # solve some of the most important <eol> us <eob> today <eob> in xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials. <eob>
In xxxxxxx shared <eob> xxxx # you # had two goals. <eob>
xxx first goal # xx <eol> the # of <eob> to train <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we xxxxxx <eob> of # <eob> technologies <eob> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how # xxx we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eol> instead of xxxxxxxx <eol> with tens xxx thousands <eob> xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx <eol> # traditional AI, <eob> we started # with # single medical image.
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way xx # extract # billions of information <eol>
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eol> on the <eob>
In a sense, # we converted # one xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, <eob> massively reducing xxx amount of <eol> needed # for training. <eol>
our second to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> we started with a # standard, <eol> xxxxx xxxxx # xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx <eob>
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something <eol> we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to xxxx efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of 10,000 <eol> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train the AI algorithms <eol> in <eob> xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using only 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eob> and <eob> # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms <eob> # can <eob> accept, <eob> in the and even <eob> some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era xxxxx # intelligence <eob> is going xx make # incredible <eol> on our xxxxxxx <eob>
And think that # thinking <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx # <eob> which # is data-rich but # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> should # also continue thinking <eob> unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> xxxxx xxx accept small xxxxxxx of data <eob> and solve some # of xxx most important <eol> problems facing # today, <eob> especially in # # care. <eob>

discovered a xxxxxxxx <eol> of # immune cell, <eob> the T xxxxx was <eol> that material that x xxxxxxxxx <eob> and # absolutely for wound healing. <eob>
Now, # just # <eob> when xxx were # a <eob> kid <eol> xxx you'd <eob> break your pencil <eob> xxx # tape back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eob> but it might not be <eol> in # most functional way, <eob> xxx we'll a scar. <eob>
# if we xxxxx have these helper T xxxxxx <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, <eob> xxx develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx # of # <eol> xxx if there's # fat our muscle, it isn't xx # <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our # xxxx grow # <eol> xxxxxxx # these scars <eol> look # # what # it <eol> we were # even injured. <eob>
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create <eob> that # give us the signals <eol> # <eob> by changing the response. <eob>
We xxxx that # <eol> x # xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx in xxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxx system will # to # it. <eob>
This # ranges # xxxx # pacemakers <eol> to <eol> insulin pumps <eob> the xxxxxxxxx that # engineers are using <eol> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xx when I place that # material, <eol> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system <eol> x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eob> that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave. <eob>
Now, <eob> # just like # xxx # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # and # <eol> entire # xx show # on Netflix, <eob> the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop. <eob>
xx we have the xxxxx signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we fat cells instead of xxxxxxx <eol>
These # scaffolds made <eol> of a variety different things, <eob> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges # that xxx # more or less # porous, xxxx # of different stiffnesses. <eob>
xxx # can even make the materials <eob> xxxxxxx # different signals <eob> xxxx time. <eob>
So in other # words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx this Broadway of cells <eob> by them # xxx <eob> stage, xxxx # <eob> that # xxx be changed for # different xxxxxxxx <eob> just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set <eob> for # "Les # "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx specific types of signals <eob> that how # our # body responds to <eol> to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eol> xx even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we # aren't xxxxx to up <eol> xxx heal xxxx Wolverine. <eob>
xxxxxxxx not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with xxxxx advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx with # <eob> our immune xxxxxx <eol> help # tissue xxx heal wounds, <eob> we could xxxxx seeing <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx market <eob> that # # body's defense system <eob> help us regenerate, <eob> maybe # xxx <eob> xxx xx able <eol> xx # keep # xxxx a xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

xx 2015, # this caused # over <eol> 25 million people xx skip meals <eob> to provide power # to their homes. <eob>

What I find # remarkable is xxxx # <eob> # birds <eol> would not be able xx # do that <eob> if xxxx # all would have <eol> xx follow one leader. <eob>
Their # xxxxx <eol> would simply # be too low. <eob>
Instead, # scientists believe <eol> that these birds xxx aligned xx <eob> few simple rules, <eob> allowing # every # xxxxxx # bird <eol> # make decisions <eob> while flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
xxxxx alignment enables # their xxxxxxxxx <eol> and their autonomy <eol> makes # fast flexible. <eob>
what # does # this xxxx xx # do <eol> # any of us? <eob>
xxxxx it's # # way illustrating <eol> xxxxxxx to xx the most change <eob> that is # # of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more complex, <eob> so # we need a xxx # way working, <eob> way that <eol> alignment around <eob> that takes xxx bureaucracy <eob> and that truly xxxxxxxx people <eob> xx make # decisions <eob> xxxxxxx <eob>
But the # is: In order to get there, <eob> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, # I was working a bank <eob> that to embark <eol> on a transformation. <eob>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, <eol> more intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm # <eob> not sure how many of you <eol> have # # from # the # inside, <eob> so let me # try # to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eob>
# of # people xx xxxxx <eob> xxxxxx elevators go <eol> xx # their department, <eob> # marketers, <eob> engineers xxxx engineers, # <eob>
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
Great xxxx end up <eol> in # PowerPoint # parking lots. <eob>
And there are <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting done forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew xxxx in # xxxxx to they would have # to improve <eol> their time to xxxxxx <eob> by drastically changing <eol> working xx <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> to xx and have # a look <eol> at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, <eob> like <eol> xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos. <eob>
I remember how we <eob> were walking <eol> halls at # xxx # of <eob> in 2014, <eob> a # management <eol> and a of bankers. <eob>
We felt # strangers in <eol> # land, surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx smart, # employees. <eob>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange <eol> xxxx # names like <eol> xxxxxxxx <eol> and and <eob> "tribes" <eob> to # explain # how they <eol> xxxx organized. <eob>
So then we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working xxx you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
xxxx you report to?" <eob> "It <eob>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that <eob> xx gained a # better <eol> understanding xx xxxxx model. <eob>
They believed the # <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
xxxxx teams like <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and IT engineers in the team <eob> so they could design, # build and test ideas with # customers <eol> independently of others the company. <eob>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
had all skills needed <eol> there xx the team. <eob>
Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eol> we # xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxxx on what xx had learned. <eob>
And # we xxx # started to # like xxxxx model, <eol> so # we # already # of how <eol> to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not # <eol> xxxx a word all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eob>
But I have for you: <eob> What are you willing to # give xxxx <eob> What were we willing xx give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not # only xxxxx <eol> embracing # the new; <eob> xxxx xxxxx giving xx <eol> on some the old as xxxxx <eob>
Now, xxxx xxx # xxxx # five <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx <eob> to change their ways # of # xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxx <eol> has # xxxxx # skeptics <eob> about # # xxxx xx not <eol> going to work # for them. <eob>
"Our product is # more complex," <eob> xx # "They xxxxx # have <eol> the legacy IT like # xx # xxxx <eob> # just won't # allow this <eol> in our industry". <eol>
xxx xxx bank and also <eol> xxx xxx other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> was possible. <eob>
Within a # <eol> year, <eob> we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, channels xxx IT. <eob>
xxxxx thousand employees xxxx reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of <eol> # <eol> sitting with # people <eol> and # engineers engineers, <eol> a product xxxxxx xxx an engineer <eol> were now members of the same # xxxxx <eob>
You could be a member of # a xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx <eob> or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, etc. <eob>
At xxx # date <eol> of that organization, <eob> people # xxxx # shaking # hands <eol> for <eob> the # # xxxxx time, <eob> only to xxxx out xxxx they xxx <eol> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other <eob> but # # were each # other emails <eol> and # status reports for the last 10 # <eob>
You # xxxxx # xxxx # xxxxxxx saying, <eob> xxxx # the # that I <eol> was always chasing # for # answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
# xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eol> together every <eob>
If product an # idea, <eob> xx can raise xx <eob> get # xxxxx from the # engineer <eol> who # is sitting right next to <eob> xxxx <eob>
They can xxxxxx to # <eol> with customers immediately # <eob> no handovers, xx # PowerPoints, # no red <eob> just # getting xxxxx done.
Now, getting there <eob> # is # xxx easy. <eob>
xxx turns # out, <eob> "What xxx you # willing to # give xxxx <eob> is exactly # xxxxxxxx <eob> # ask.
xxxxxxxxxx decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
Instead xx # decisions going <eol> up and xxxx the organization, <eob> want the team to # decide. <eob>
But # to do so, we need all # the # skills <eol> and # expertise for # that decision <eob> in # team. <eol>
xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we physically co-locate # our xxxxxx <eol> who # are in # different <eob> different cities or even <eol> # countries today? <eob>
Or # should we <eol> in # better xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # do we consistency <eol> in # way xx do <eol> across these teams?
xx # need xxxx kind <eol> matrix.
Now, # all changes to structure <eob> and process and # procedure -- <eob> they are # <eob>
But # xxx I # xxxxx that xxx xxxx <eol> difficult # xxxxx # to change <eob> xx our xxx behavior. <eob>
Let me xxx xx # illustrate.
If we # want these # <eol> teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eol> have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eol>
# this means xx # cannot leaders <eol> commanding their people what # to xxx <eob> when # <eol> xx do, how to xxx <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
# it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eob> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eob> xx take <eob>
obviously, xx also <eob> xx have all # these teams <eol> # in different directions, <eob> xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment and autonomy <eol> at the # xxxx xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eob>
an xxxxxxxxxxxxxx setting, <eob> xxxx requires # behaviors, <eob> xxx xxxx each new xxxxxxxxx <eol> there xx giving up on something xxx as well. <eob>
Leaders have # make sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the <eob> is aligned <eol> xxxxxxx # # -- the xxx -- <eob> the xxxxxxxxxx # the what. <eob>
But then # they have to xxx # <eol> xx <eol> and trust their <eob> xx # make xxxxx decisions <eol> on xxx xx # get # <eol> there.
xxxx creating xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx you know how # information x xxxxxx of # power? <eob>
Well, # some managers, may feel xx if <eol> they're giving up xxxx source xx power. <eob>
# xxxx not xxxx # managers. <eob>
The teams need # xx communicate <eol> openly and # as # well.
xx # these xxxxxxxxxx the <eol> xxxxxxxxx in # short sprints, and # at # xxx # xxx # sprint, <eol> organize a demo <eob> # xxxxxxx <eob> to share the output <eob> of what # done, <eob>
And every day, <eob> # member # of xxx team gives an update <eob> of xxxx they are working individually. <eob>
Now, all # transparency <eol> uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> because suddenly, # there is <eol> place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything do <eol> for # xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, alignment <eob> xxx easy, <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # autonomy <eol> is so obvious, either. <eob>

That is radical <eol> for # someone be <eol> a xxxxxx # xx milestone-tracking. <eob>
But # xx the # world, said, <eob> xx only had the illusion of <eob>
In reality, # <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxx would run <eol> xxxx time and over xxxxxxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
Now I have xxxx transparency, xxx I can xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> much earlier xx needed". <eob>
xxx middle to change as well. <eob>
First # all, without xxx handovers <eol> xxx # the <eob> xxxx of x need <eol> for managers. <eob>
And in the # old xxxxx # was <eob> # # of thinkers and doers. <eol>
Employees # would just xxxxxx # orders. <eol>
But xxxx instead <eob> of <eol> other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eol> to # player-coaches. <eob>
xx imagine, for the last xx # years, <eol> have # just been # telling <eol> other people # to do, <eob> now you're expected <eob> xx do things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
# xxxx model is not # for everyone, <eol> some xxxxxx # leave the # xxxxxxxx <eob>
# # is new # <eob> less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this xx # work. <eol>
But # worth it. <eob>
The companies that I # with, <eob> they were used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> new product features # a few per # year. <eol>
they # have # releases every # few # weeks, <eob> and without the # handovers <eol> and the # xxx # tape, the # whole organization xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
finally, if you xxx # halls <eol> # companies today, <eob> xxx just feel # a xxx energy. <eob>
feels xx if xxxxxx # walking <eol> the halls of # x very start-up.
xxxx to be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot # claim victory <eob>
But # at # least with # xxxx new # <eol> model, <eob> they are much xxxxxx # prepared <eol> to change. <eob>
xxx # xxxxx # getting faster and more xxxxxxxx <eob> so we need to reboot xxx way of # working. <eob>
And xxx xxxxxxx part # of that change <eol> is xxx # xx structure <eob> process # or # procedure, <eob> and it's also # not just <eol> xxxxxx executives xxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxx will be xxx xx those <eol> in xxx # <eob> who embrace the <eob>

As long they # xxx # xxxx xxxx # care xxxxx they <eob>
Our distributed # work <eol> xxxxxx # xxxxxx accidentally. <eob>
xx was # <eob> x # # choice <eob> from the very <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I don't use xxx # word xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx it <eol> up expectation, <eob> that # people # xxx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eol> where # everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think <eob> # a workforce <eob> is the # most <eob> effective xxx to build x # company. <eob>
The key xx # you have to <eol> approach it # <eob>
When # xx started WordPress, <eob> many # of # the first 20 xxxxx <eol> were I'd never # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to # continue # that <eol> xxx simple reason. <eob>
I believe that # talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> # world. <eob> But opportunity # not. <eob>
In Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the small # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eol> can # fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone who grew # xx <eol> in Japan but lives in <eob> you # can gain # someone who lives, works, <eob> # up goes # sleep <eol> xxxxxxxx # they # are # the world. <eob> They xxxxx # a different <eol> understanding that culture <eob> and a # lived # <eob>
At xxx xxxx xx xxx decision <eol> to go # distributed, a desire # give people autonomy <eol> xxxx # # they xx xxxxx work. <eob>
you're a # <eol> where specific hours are <eob> you can make # your xxx schedule. <eob>
Everyone xxx have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want # eat, xxx # choose xxxx # music <eol> and # # # silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx what <eob> temperature <eol> the room xxxxxx # be. <eob>
You can save the xxxx <eol> you'd # spend # commuting <eob> and put it xxxx # things that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company. <eob>
But often ask me, <eob> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, <eol> about # everyone xxxxxx <eob> If you <eob> xxxx an office, <eob> xxx can do # # things <eol> to distributed capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In xx office, it's <eol> easy <eol> to xxxx decisions in the moment, <eob> the kitchen, in the <eob>
if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the <eol> are xxxxx they don't have access to, <eol> they'll see these decisions being made <eol> understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave # of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about. <eob>
This # allows others # # pick up <eol> where <eob> left off. <eob>
allows people in different <eol> time zones to xxxxxxxxx also great to # think about <eol> as an organization <eob> people xxxxxxx and people joining. <eob>
Try # have # as much # communication <eol> possible xxxxxxx <eob>
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eob>
You need to xxxx the right tools. <eob>
are many xxxx and services <eob> that with # day-to-day communication, <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that # changed xxx you xxxx <eol> probably aren't # xxxxxxx # anymore. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your # <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> xxxxx collaboration, see # what works. <eob>
Create # <eob> productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eol>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the # same place <eol> 48 # weeks # out of # the year and # might <eol> # or <eol> # four apart. <eob>
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. <eob> Once a year xx xxxxx # meet-up <eob> xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx <eob> for week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
xxx goal is # people. <eob> # want to sure everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> and # have a # deeper connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When work # together <eol> rest of the year, <eol> they together <eol> that # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people flexibility <eol> to make their xxx work environment. <eob>
Every person # <eol> a co-working # <eob> xxxx they can put <eol> xxxxxxx # a <eob> or # xxxx to buy coffee, so # xxxxx <eol> get kicked # out xx # xxx # coffee # <eob>
One in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together <eob> and <eol> rented a # <eob> xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing xxxxx <eob>
Each person who # # the company <eol> gets a <eob>
This is money they # can invest <eol> in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, <eob> xxx # desk so # xxxx have <eol> the most productive environment xxx them. <eob>
xxxxxx there # just a # few companies <eol> that are xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx <eol> that percent of companies <eob> are # # changing <eol> xxx course of the world are going # to # this # way. <eob>
They will # evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eol> they'll be replaced by those xxxx
As you # xxxxx about <eol> xxxxx to xxxxx next, <eob> consider how xxx can tap <eol> into # global talent, xxxx # people autonomy to live <eol> where they feel they # should <eob> participate # fully in whatever <eol> it is # xxxx you're creating <eob>
