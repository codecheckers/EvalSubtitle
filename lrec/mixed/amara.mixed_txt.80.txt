xxx xx # <eob> by # using # what <eol> xxxxx # our # system, <eob> I was # able # # identify # xxxxxxx <eob> # fight # to # build xxxx <eol> our cuts # bruises. <eob>
When looking at xxxxxxxxx <eol> # are # xxxxx # tested <eob> xxxxx abilities # to help # xxxxxx # xxxxxxx <eob> our xxxx # that after xxxxxxxx <eol> an # xxxxxxx muscle # xxxx these # materials, <eob> xxxxx # # x xxxxx # number # xxxxxx cells <eob> xx xxxxxxxx <eol> # surrounding <eob>

# specific <eol> xxxx of # xxxxxx xxxxx <eob> xxx # # cell, <eob> was present # inside <eol> xxxx material # # <eob> xxxxxxxxxx critical healing. <eob>
Now, # like xxxx a <eol> xxx you'd # xxxxx xxxx xxxxxx <eob> and try and back # together # <eob> xx can # <eob> xxx it xxxxx not xx <eol> # most xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and we'll get a <eob>
xx if xxxxx # xxxx # helper # x xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx healthy <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx # xxx <eob> and fat in our muscle, <eol> isn't xx strong. <eob>
Now, xxxxx xxx # immune system, <eob> xxx # xxxxx xxxx # back <eol> these # scars <eob> xxxx like what # xxx <eol> before we # were xxxx <eob>
I'm working # # create <eob> give us xxx signals <eol> # build xxx <eob> xx # the # immune # response. <eob>
We # any # time <eol> x material xx # implanted # body, <eob> the # immune xxxxxx xxxx respond # it. <eob>
This from pacemakers <eol> xx # pumps <eob> # that # engineers # xxx using <eol> xx # xxx # new xxxxxxx <eob>
when # that # material, <eol> or # scaffold, in the xxxxx <eob> the # system # <eol> a xxxxx environment # cells and xxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx can way <eol> that xxx # stem xxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Now, just # like xxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # daily # <eob> xxxx xxxxx for a xxx <eob> or xxxxxxx xxx binge-watching <eol> an entire # Netflix, <eob> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx of scaffold <eob> # xxx that <eol> # xxxx # cells # and xxxxxxxx <eob>

xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx # xxxx # materials <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx over # time. <eob>
So in other words, we orchestrate <eol> xxxx # Broadway show xx cells <eob> xx giving them # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx cues and <eob> xxxx # be changed # different <eob> xxxx x producer would # change # # xxx <eob> xxx "Les # Mis" versus <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx of Horrors". <eob>
I'm # combining # specific # types of signals <eob> that # mimic how # our # xxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> xx help # us <eob>
# # we # see <eol> x # scar-proof band-aid, <eob> moldable muscle filler <eol> or xxxx x # wound-healing # vaccine. <eob>

xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we # physically co-locate <eol> who are # working # in xxxxxxxxx buildings, <eob> different # <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eob>
xx should xx invest <eol> xx better # <eob>
