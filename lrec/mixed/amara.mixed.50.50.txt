xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, the issued a proposal <eol> to build the # first # ever <eol> cloud database for # Medicaid. <eol>

Here's # <eob> to tell # you why.
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my xxxxxx from <eol> today # it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid.
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx story xxxxxxxx <eol> to be # told with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's story tells xx that a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's # <eob> xx xxxx to xxxx # accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eol> xxxx # are inspiring, <eob> xxx # they're # x of vaccine against <eob> # # thinking.

What # is history? <eol>

But this project, # we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eol> xxx # a # <eol> xx any other country could or still can. <eol>
Reading # the posts 1917, <eob> you learn Russia was the # first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eol> or # xxx # of xxx first <eob> ones xx xxxxx # women voting #

Thousands of xxxxxxxx every xxxx <eob> lose their lives <eol> due xx # liver and # cancer. <eob>
Our best way xx # help these patients <eob> is # # perform early and diagnoses xxxxx <eob>
So how do we <eol> detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx <eob>
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx # # diseases, <eob> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive xxxxxxx # imaging technologies as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx to be xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
are collected, <eol> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images and talks to # the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eol> a very resource-intensive <eol> requiring xxxx # expert physicians, <eol> xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and is xxx considered practical <eol> for xxx developing <eob>
And in fact, in # many <eol> industrialized # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx traditional <eob> artificial intelligence <eob> xx # solve this # problem, <eob> I would <eob> require -- <eob> x repeat, on xx order # of 10,000 of these very medical <eob> xx # generated. <eob>
After <eob> # xxxxx # then go <eol> # expert physician, <eol> would xxxx <eol> those images xxx xxx
And those <eol> two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train xxxx neural network <eol> xx x xxxx learning network <eol> to provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis. <eol>
Similar xx the # first # approach, traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob>
Large of expert physicians <eol> xxx expert medical imaging <eob> # <eob>
So, # can we invent xxxx scalable, effective and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence <eol> architectures <eob> to <eol> solve # these xxxx important <eob> problems # facing us xxxxxx <eol>
And this is xxxxxxx what my # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented # a <eol> of AI # architectures <eob> to <eob> # solve some of the most important <eol> us today <eob> in xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials. <eol>
In xxxxxxx shared <eob> xxxx # you # had two goals. <eob>
xxx first goal # xx <eol> the # of <eob> to train <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we xxxxxx <eob> of # technologies <eol> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how # xxx we do it?
For our first goal, <eol> instead of xxxxxxxx <eol> with tens xxx thousands <eob> xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx <eol> # traditional AI, <eob> we started # with # single medical image. <eol>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way <eob> xx # extract <eob> # billions <eol> of information <eob>
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eol> on the <eob>
In a sense, # we converted # one <eob> xxxx billions of # training xxxx <eob> # points, <eob> massively reducing xxx amount of <eol> needed # for training.
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> we started with a # standard, <eob> xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera <eob> xx <eob> a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx <eob>
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something <eob> we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to xxxx efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our <eob> approach, <eob> instead <eol> of 10,000 xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train the AI algorithms <eob> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using only 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> <eob> acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eob> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms <eob> # can accept, <eob> in the and even <eob> some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I <eob> xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era <eob> xxxxx # intelligence <eob> is going xx make # incredible on our xxxxxxx <eob>
And think that # thinking <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx # which # is data-rich but # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> should # also continue thinking <eol> unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, <eob> xxxxx xxx accept small xxxxxxx of data <eob> and solve some # of xxx most important problems facing # today, <eol> especially in # # care. <eob>

discovered a xxxxxxxx of # immune cell, <eob> the T <eol> xxxxx <eob> was that material that x xxxxxxxxx <eol> and # absolutely for wound healing. <eob>
Now, # just # when xxx were # a kid <eob> xxx <eol> you'd break <eob> your pencil <eob> xxx # tape back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eob> but it might not be <eob> in # most functional way, <eol> xxx we'll a scar. <eob>
# if we xxxxx have these helper T xxxxxx <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, <eob> xxx develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx # of # <eob> xxx if there's # fat our muscle, <eol> it isn't xx # <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eol> our # xxxx grow # xxxxxxx # these scars <eob> look # # what # <eob> it <eol> we were # even injured. <eob>
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create <eol> that # give us the signals <eob> # <eob> by changing the response. <eob>
We xxxx that # x # xxxxxxxx <eol> xx xxxxxxxxx in xxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxx system will <eol> # to # it. <eob>
This # ranges # xxxx # pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps the xxxxxxxxx that <eol> # engineers are using <eol> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xx when I place that # material, <eol> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eob> that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave.
Now, # just like # xxx # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eob> like <eol> going for x run <eob> or staying inside # and # <eol> entire # xx show # <eol> on Netflix, the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem # <eob> cells xxxx xxx develop. <eob>
xx we have the xxxxx signals, say the Netflix signals, <eol> we <eob> fat cells instead of xxxxxxx <eob>
These # scaffolds made of a variety different things, <eob> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eob> derived <eob> materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eol> sponges # that xxx # more <eol> or less # porous, <eob> xxxx # of different stiffnesses. <eol>
xxx # can even <eob> make the materials <eob> xxxxxxx # different signals xxxx time. <eob>
So in other # words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> this Broadway of cells <eob> by them # xxx <eol> stage, <eob> xxxx # that # xxx be changed for # different xxxxxxxx just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set <eob> for # "Les # <eol> "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx specific types of signals that how # our # body responds to <eol> to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eol> xx even a wound-healing vaccine.
Now, we # aren't <eob> xxxxx to up <eol> xxx heal xxxx Wolverine. <eob>
xxxxxxxx not next <eol> Tuesday, either. <eob>
But <eob> with xxxxx advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx with # our immune xxxxxx help # tissue xxx heal wounds, we could xxxxx seeing <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx market <eob> that # # body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eol> maybe # xxx xxx xx able <eol> xx # keep # xxxx a <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

What I find <eob> # remarkable is xxxx # # birds <eob> would <eol> not be able xx # do that <eol> if xxxx # all would have <eol> xx follow one leader. <eob>

xxxxx alignment enables # their xxxxxxxxx <eol> and their autonomy makes # fast <eol> flexible. <eob>
what # does # this xxxx xx # do <eol> # any of us? <eol>
xxxxx it's # # way illustrating <eol> xxxxxxx to xx the most change <eob> that is # # of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more complex, <eol> so # we need a xxx # way working, <eob> way that <eol> alignment around <eob> that takes <eol> xxx bureaucracy and that truly xxxxxxxx people xx make # decisions xxxxxxx <eob>
But the # is: <eob> In order to get there, <eol> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, # I was <eob> working a bank <eob> that to embark <eol> on a transformation. <eob>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, more intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eol>
Now, I'm # not sure how many of you <eol> have <eol> # # from # the # inside, <eob> so let me # try <eob> # to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eob>
# of # people xx xxxxx xxxxxx elevators go <eol> xx # their <eob> department, <eol> # marketers, <eol> engineers <eob> xxxx engineers, # <eob>
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
Great xxxx end <eol> up <eol> in # PowerPoint # parking lots. <eob>
And there are <eol> between departments. <eol>
Getting <eol> done forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew <eol> xxxx in # xxxxx to <eob> they would have # to improve <eol> their time to <eob> xxxxxx <eob> by drastically changing <eol> working xx <eob>
But how? <eob>
To <eob> get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> to xx and have # a look at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, <eob> # Zappos. <eol>
I remember how we were walking <eob> halls at # xxx # of <eob> in 2014, <eob> a # <eob> management <eol> and a of bankers.
We felt # strangers in # land, <eob> surrounded <eol> by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx <eob> smart, # employees. <eob>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx # they <eob> used strange <eob> xxxx # names like xxxxxxxx <eol> and and "tribes" to # explain # how they xxxx organized.
So then we tried to <eob> # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working xxx you?" <eob> "It depends".
xxxx you report to?" <eob> "It <eob>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that <eob> xx gained a # better <eol> understanding <eol> xx xxxxx model. <eob>
They believed the # <eob> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
xxxxx teams like <eol>
xxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and IT engineers in the team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers <eol> independently of others the company. <eob>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
had all skills needed there xx the team. <eob>
Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eob> we # xxxxxxx <eob> to <eol> xxxxxxx on what xx had learned. <eol>
And # we xxx # started to # like xxxxx model, <eob> so # we # already # of how <eol> to # apply # # of these ideas <eob> # xx a bank.
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not # xxxx a word all # day, he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eob>
But I have for you: <eob> What are you willing to # give xxxx What were we willing <eol> xx give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not # only xxxxx <eol> embracing # the new; xxxx xxxxx giving xx <eob> on some the old as xxxxx
Now, xxxx xxx <eob> # xxxx # five <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx to change their ways # of # xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxx has # xxxxx # skeptics about # # xxxx xx not <eol> going to work # for them. <eob>
"Our product is # more complex," <eob> xx # "They xxxxx # have <eol> the <eob> legacy IT like # xx # xxxx <eob> # just won't # allow this <eob> in our industry". <eob>
xxx xxx bank and also xxx xxx other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, <eol> was possible.
Within a # year, we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx product, channels xxx IT.
xxxxx thousand employees xxxx reorganized into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of # <eol> sitting with # people <eob> and # engineers engineers, a <eol> product xxxxxx <eob> xxx an engineer <eol> were now members of the same # xxxxx
You could be a member of # a xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx <eob> or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, etc. <eob>
At xxx <eob> # date <eol> of <eol> that organization, <eob> people # xxxx # shaking # <eob> hands <eol> for the # <eol> # xxxxx time, <eol> only to xxxx out xxxx they xxx <eol> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other but # # were each # other emails <eob> and # status reports for the last 10 # <eob>
You # xxxxx # xxxx # xxxxxxx saying, xxxx # the # that I <eob> was always chasing # for # answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
# <eob> xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eol> together every <eob>
If <eol> product an # idea, <eol> xx can raise xx get <eob> # xxxxx from the # engineer <eol> who # is sitting right next to xxxx <eol>
They <eob> can xxxxxx to # <eol> with customers immediately # <eob> no handovers, <eob> xx # PowerPoints, # no red <eol> just # getting <eob> xxxxx done. <eob>
Now, getting there # is # xxx easy.
xxx turns # out, <eob> "What xxx you # willing to # give xxxx <eol> is exactly # xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx decision-making requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
Instead <eol> xx # decisions going <eol> up and xxxx the organization, <eob> want the team to # <eob> decide. <eob>
But # to do so, we need all # the <eob> # <eob> skills and # expertise for # that decision <eol> in # team. <eob>
xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we physically co-locate # our xxxxxx <eol> who # are in # different <eol> different cities or even # countries today? <eob>
Or # should we <eob> in # better xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx # do <eob> we consistency <eol> in # way xx do <eol> across these teams? <eob>
xx # need xxxx kind <eol> matrix. <eob>
Now, # all changes to structure <eob> and process and # procedure -- <eol> they are # <eob>
But # xxx <eol> I # xxxxx <eob> that xxx xxxx difficult # xxxxx # to change <eob> xx our xxx behavior. <eob>
Let me xxx xx # illustrate.
If we # want <eol> these # teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, <eol> creative, like <eol> a mini-start-up, <eol> have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eob>
# this means xx # cannot leaders <eol> commanding their people what # to xxx <eol> when # xx do, how to xxx <eob>
No micromanagers.
# it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eob> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eol> xx take
obviously, xx also <eob> xx have all # these teams <eol> # in different directions, <eob> xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment and autonomy <eob> at the # xxxx xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eob>
an xxxxxxxxxxxxxx setting, <eob> xxxx requires # behaviors, <eob> xxx xxxx each new xxxxxxxxx <eob> there xx giving up on something xxx <eob> as well. <eob>
Leaders have # make sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the <eob> is aligned <eol> xxxxxxx # # -- the xxx -- <eol> the xxxxxxxxxx # <eob> the what. <eob>
But then # they have to xxx # xx <eol> and trust their <eob> xx # make xxxxx decisions <eol> on xxx xx # get # there. <eob>
xxxx creating xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx you know how # <eol> information x xxxxxx of # power? <eob>
Well, <eob> # some managers, <eob> may feel xx if <eol> they're giving up xxxx source xx power.
# xxxx not xxxx # managers. <eol>
The teams need # xx communicate <eol> openly and # as # well.
xx # these xxxxxxxxxx the <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> in # short sprints, <eob> and # at # xxx # xxx # sprint, <eol> organize a demo # xxxxxxx <eob> to share the output <eol> of what # done, <eob>
And every day, <eob> # member # of xxx <eol> team gives an update of xxxx they are working individually. <eob>
Now, all # transparency <eol> uncomfortable xxx people, because suddenly, # there is <eol> place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything do <eol> for # xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So, alignment <eob> xxx easy, <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # autonomy <eol> is so obvious, either. <eob>

That is radical <eol> for <eob> # <eob> someone be <eob> a xxxxxx # xx milestone-tracking.
But # xx the # world, said, <eob> xx only had the illusion of <eob>
In reality, # xxxx # xxxxxxxx would run <eol> xxxx time and over xxxxxxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
Now <eol> I have xxxx <eob> transparency, xxx I can xxxxxxxxxxxxxx much earlier xx needed". <eob>
xxx <eol> middle <eol> to change as well. <eob>
First # all, without xxx handovers <eol> xxx # the <eob> xxxx of x need <eol> for managers. <eob>
And in the # old xxxxx # was <eol> # # <eob> of thinkers and doers. <eol>
Employees # would just xxxxxx # orders. <eob>
But xxxx instead of other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eol> to # player-coaches. <eol>
xx imagine, for the last xx # years, <eob> have # just been # telling other people # to do, <eob> now you're expected xx do things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
# xxxx model is not # for everyone, <eob> some xxxxxx # leave the # xxxxxxxx <eob>
# # is new # <eob> less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this xx # work. <eob>
But # worth it. <eob>
The companies that I # with, <eob> they were used # xxxxxxxxx new product features # a <eob> few per # year. <eob>
they # have # releases every # few # weeks, <eob> and without the # handovers <eol> and the # xxx # tape, <eob> the # whole organization <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
finally, if you xxx <eol> # halls <eol> # companies today, <eob> xxx just feel # a xxx energy. <eob>
feels xx if xxxxxx # <eob> walking the halls of # x very start-up. <eob>
xxxx to be fair, these companies, they cannot # claim victory <eob>
But # at # least with # xxxx new # model, <eol> they are much xxxxxx # prepared <eol> to change. <eob>
xxx # xxxxx # getting faster <eob> and more xxxxxxxx so we need to reboot xxx way of # working.
And xxx xxxxxxx part # of that change <eol> is xxx # xx structure <eob> process # or # procedure, <eob> and it's also # not just <eol> xxxxxx <eob> executives xxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxx will be xxx xx those <eol> in xxx # who embrace the <eob>

I don't use xxx # word xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx it up expectation, that # people # xxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use <eob> the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where # everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think <eol> # a workforce is the # most effective xxx <eob> to build <eob> x # company. <eob>
The key xx # you have to <eol> approach it #
When # xx started WordPress, <eob> many # of # the first 20 xxxxx were I'd never <eob> # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to # continue # that xxx simple reason.
I believe that # talent and intelligence are equally distributed <eob> # world. <eob> But opportunity # not. <eob>
In Valley, big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the small # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eol> can # fish from the entire ocean. <eob>

Everyone xxx have a corner office, xxxxx windows, the food they want # eat, <eol> xxx # choose xxxx <eol> # music <eol> and # # # silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx what temperature <eol> the room xxxxxx # be. <eob>
You can save <eob> the xxxx <eob> you'd # spend # commuting <eob> and put it xxxx # things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company.
But often ask me, <eob> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, about # everyone xxxxxx <eol> If you xxxx an office, <eob> xxx can do # # things <eob> to distributed capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In xx office, <eob> it's easy <eol> to xxxx decisions in the moment, <eob> the kitchen, in the
if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the <eol> are xxxxx <eol> they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made <eob> understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave # of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about. <eob>
This # allows others # # pick up <eol> where left off. <eob>
allows people in different time zones to xxxxxxxxx <eob> also great to # think about <eol> as an organization <eol> people xxxxxxx and people joining.
Try # have # <eob> as much # communication <eob> possible xxxxxxx
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eob>
You need to xxxx the right tools. <eob>

The things that # changed xxx you xxxx <eol> probably aren't # xxxxxxx # anymore. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your # <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> xxxxx collaboration, <eob> see # what works. <eob>
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the # same place <eol> 48 # weeks # out of # the year <eob> and # might <eol> # or # four <eob> apart.
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # <eob> intense bursts. <eob> Once a year xx xxxxx # meet-up xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx <eol> for week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
xxx goal is # people. <eol> # want to sure <eol> everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> and # have a # deeper connection <eol> with <eob> their <eob> colleagues. <eob>
When work # together <eol> rest of the year, they together <eol> that # understanding and empathy.

In a or # xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx that percent of companies <eob> are # # changing <eol> xxx course of the world <eob> are going # to # this # way.
