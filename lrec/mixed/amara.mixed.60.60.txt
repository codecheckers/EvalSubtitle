For our xxxxx goal, <eol> instead # <eob> xx starting <eol> tens and # thousands xx these very # expensive # medical <eob> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we started with a # xxxxxxx image. <eob>

This from # pacemakers <eol> to <eob> insulin xxxxx <eob> to the # materials that # engineers xxxxx <eol> to try # and build new tissue. <eol>
xx when I place xxxxxxxxx or scaffold, # in the body, <eob> the # xxxxxx # # xxxxxxx <eol> a small environment of cells # and <eob> proteins <eob> can # change the # way <eol> that our # stem # cells behave. <eob>
xxxx just like # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx our daily activities, <eob> xxxx # run <eob> or <eob> # staying # inside binge-watching <eol> an <eob> entire xx show on Netflix, <eob> the immune <eol> # a xxxxxxxx <eol> affects xxx # way that <eob> our # xxxx cells xxx <eol> develop. <eob>

What I find # <eol> is that xxxxx <eob> # able xx that <eob> if # xxxx # all would have <eol> xx <eol> follow one leader. <eob>

Now, xxxx # does # have # xx xx <eol> with any one xx # us? <eob>
Well, xxxx # one way xx what <eob> x to be the most change <eob> xxxx is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eob> xxx complex, <eob> so xx xxxx a new # <eob> way # xx working, <eol> way <eol> that creates <eol> alignment around # purpose, <eob> xxxx xxxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that xxxxx empowers <eob> xx # decisions <eob>
But xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> order to get there, <eob> what <eob> are # we willing xx # give # up? <eob>
A few <eol> ago, x <eob> was with x xxxx <eol> wanted to <eol> on x #
They wanted their to simpler, more more # relevant. <eol>
Now, xxx not xxx # many of # you have seen x from the # xxxxxxx <eob> so xx try # to illustrate <eol> what many traditional # banks xxxx like. <eob>
xxx see # lots <eol> xx # people <eol> suits <eob> taking elevators to # go <eol> to # department, xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, engineers with etc.
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people <eob> where gets xxxxxxxx <eol>
ideas? They end # up <eob> xx PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can take xxxxxxxx <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> xxxx in # # transform, <eol> xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx <eob> their time xx # market drastically changing their # # of # # xx well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
xx # get some xxxxxxx <eol> xx # xx and # # <eol> a look # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to xx more # innovative, like Google, Netflix, # Spotify, <eob> Zappos. <eol>
xxx I remember how # we # <eol> the # halls at # these companies xx # <eob> December 2014, <eob> a management # consultant <eol> and x # team of bankers. <eob>
xxxx # strangers # a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # <eol> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we # asked, <eol> "How xx your company organized?" <eob> And xx expected xx xxx xx org
xxx instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx <eob> drawings <eob> xxxx # funny xxxxx like # xxxxxxxx <eol> and "chapters" # "tribes" <eob> xx explain how were organized.
So then # we tried translate <eob> xxxx our # own world.
We asked, "How many xxxxxx <eol> are <eol> xxxxxxx # you?" # depends". <eol>
# do # report <eol> <eob>
"Who xxxxxxx on # <eob> priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You xxx # imagine # our <eob>
We # were # asking xxx some # the basic # <eol> xxxxxxxxxx of organizations, <eol> and answer xxxx xxx depends". <eob>
Now, course <eob> # of that xxxx <eob> gained # <eob> a # better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their
They in xxx power <eol> xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups. <eob>
had # # people <eol> and # engineers # in the same team <eob> so they could # design, # build <eob> and <eob> test ideas # customers <eob> independently of others xx the company.
xxxx # did <eol> xxxx # handovers <eol> # <eol>
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed <eol> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, # at the of that <eol> x # session # reflect xx what xx had # learned. <eol>
# we <eob> xxx # started to # their # model, <eob> so xx were thinking of how xxxxx some of # these ideas xx a # xxxxx
But then, one # of hosts, <eob> a who said # a # all day, <eol> xx suddenly said, xxx you xxx xxxxxx <eol>
But <eob> x have <eol> one question you: What xxx willing # to # xxxx up?" <eol> xxxx xx xxxxxxx to <eob> # give up? <eob>
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, but # we xxxx he was right.
# xx not # <eol> only embracing the <eob> it's <eob> about up <eob> some of # xxx old as well.
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx # have # with companies <eob> xxxx xxx # xxxxx to # xxxxxx ways of # working. <eol>
xxxxxxxx # every company <eob> has their xxx skeptics <eob> about why # this # is not <eol> going # xx work # for # <eob>
xxxx # product is # more complex," <eob> or "They don't xxxx <eol> the legacy # IT like do," <eol> "Regulators # just won't allow this xx # our industry". <eob>
But for this # also <eob> xxx # companies <eol> that x xxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> was possible. <eob>
x <eob> # we completely <eol> xxxx # up old silos <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx channels # and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
So instead of product xxxxxx <eol> sitting xxxx xxxx product people and engineers # with engineers, <eob> a product person # xx <eob> engineer <eol> were members of # same xxxxx <eob>
xxx xxxxx # xx # member of # a team <eob> responsible account # opening or for the # mobile <eol> banking xxxx etc. <eob>
At xxxxxxx date <eob> that # <eol> new xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # people were shaking # xxxxx <eol> for # xxx very first only <eob> # # find # out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away # xxxx # each # <eob> but they were sending each # other emails xxx status # xxx the # last # 10 # years. <eol>
# would xxxx someone saying, <eol> # xx you're the guy that <eol> was for answers". (Laughter) <eol>
now, # they're <eol> # xxxxxx together # every <eol>
If the product # # an # xxxxx <eol> he # xxxx xxxxx <eob> it <eob> to # get input from # the engineer <eob> who # xxxxxxx xxxx <eob>
can decide to <eob> # test <eob> with xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx -- no # xx PowerPoints, no red tape, just # getting xxxxx done.
# getting # is xxx easy. <eol>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What <eob> # you # willing # to # xxxx # up?" <eob> is exactly the right question <eob> to ask. <eob>
Autonomous <eob> # <eol> requires # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions going up and down the organization, we want # xxxx # # decide. <eob>
But # to xx so, xxxx all the skills <eob> xxx expertise # for that decision <eol> in <eob>
# this brings trade-offs. <eob>
# we physically xxx xxxxxx <eob> who are in different buildings, <eob> xxxxxxxxx cities xx even <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today?
Or # xx <eol> in # better videoconferencing? <eol>
xxx <eob> do we # <eob> xxxxxx in # <eob> the way we do xxxxxx <eob> these teams?
We xxxxx xxxx # <eob> of xxxxxxxxxx matrix. <eol>
# xxx # these xxxxxxx <eob> xx xxxxxxxxx and process # and xx <eol> they # not xxxxx <eol>
But <eob> the xxxx <eol> I xxxxx # that # # most <eol> difficult # xx # change <eob> is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx me try <eob>
xxxx # <eob> these <eob> teams # be fast, flexible, # <eol> # x # <eob> they xxxx to # <eob> be <eob> empowered xxx autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx leaders <eol> commanding # their # people what <eob> to # xxx <eob> when to do, how # xx <eob>
No # micromanagers. <eob>
But it means that each employee <eol> xxxxx # xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # formal xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx # xx <eol> xx xxxx initiative.
# xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx # xxxx cannot afford <eob> xxxx all # these teams <eob> in xxxxxxxxx directions, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxx would <eol> certainly # lead to chaos. <eol>
we # and xxxxxxxx <eol> at # same xxxxx <eob> just # xxxx flock # of birds. <eob>
an organizational # setting, requires new behaviors, <eob> xxx with xxxx behavior, there is up on # old well. <eol>
Leaders # xxxx to make sure xxxx everyone in the organization is xxxxxxx # around <eob> the purpose <eol> xx the # why -- <eol> the overall # priorities -- xxx # xxxxx <eol>
then # have to <eol> let # go and # <eob> xxxx the right decisions <eob> # how # to get there. <eol>
Now, creating xxxxxxxxx requires open # xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication. <eob>
But you know # how they # xxx <eol> that # information # <eob> source # of power?
xxxxx for some # managers, <eol> xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if # giving # up that xxxxxx of # power. <eob>
And it's just # xxxxxxxxx <eol>
teams <eob> xxxxxx and # <eol> xx # well. <eob>
xx xxx # teams typically # xxxx xxxxx <eob> and xx # <eob> end of # every sprint, they organize # a xxxx # <eol> to share the <eol> of what done, # <eob> transparently. <eob>
And # day, <eob> each # member of # # xxxx gives an <eob> of they are xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable # for # people, <eob> because # suddenly, <eol> there <eob> xx xxxxx to hide # anymore.
Everything we <eob> xxx everyone. <eob>
So, is xxx # <eob> and # is not # # either. <eob>
One # executive # <eob> likes # xx how xx xxxx to be a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, <eob> today, to # <eol> xxxx how # are # going, instead # of xxxxxxx at status # reports, <eob> he # needs to walk # # # # xxxx floors <eol> one of # their sessions. <eob>
instead of # people xxxx to do, he looks # ways to # help # them. <eob>
xxxx is <eob> change <eob> for <eob> # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eol> # xxxxxx of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # the old world, xxxx executive xxxxx <eob> "I only the xxxxxxxx control. <eol>
In reality, projects would # run <eol> over <eob> time over anyway.
Now I have <eob> much more transparency, <eol> and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> earlier xxxxxxxx
And middle xxxxxxxx <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without <eol> the PowerPoint, <eob> there's # less # of # a need <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And # in xxx # there was <eol> # idea of and doers. <eob>
# would # xxxx follow <eob> orders. <eob>
But # # instead of xxxx <eob> other <eol> middle managers # expected <eol> to become # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx <eol> # xxx the last xx <eob> you xxxx been # telling <eol> other xxxxxx # what xx <eol> but xxxxxx expected <eol> # xx things yourself <eob>
xxxxxxxx # this model # is xxx xxx everyone, xxx <eol> # xxxx great # people leave # the <eob>
xxx xxx <eob> result # a # culture <eob> xxxx less # <eob>
xxx of xxxx # xxxx work. <eob>
But # it.
The companies that # x worked with, <eol> they # were used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx features # few # times # year.
Now xxxx # every few weeks, <eob> and # xxx handovers # # red tape, # whole # xxxxxxxxxxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # finally, xxxx # <eol> these # companies xxxxxx just a # new <eol>
feels as # if you're walking <eol> the halls of xxxxx <eob>
Now, to xxxxx these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But # at xxxxx this # <eob> xxx model, <eol> # are much better prepared <eol> to respond # <eob>
The world getting # faster xxx # more xxxxxxxx so we to reboot our # of # working.
And xxx hardest # xxxx of that # xxxxxx <eol> is # <eob> in # structure <eob> or process <eob> # or procedure, <eob> and it's also # not just <eol> xxxxxx executives taking charge. <eob>
