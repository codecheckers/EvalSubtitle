Imagine waking up # to a stranger -- sometimes # multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an <eob> angry message, <eob> and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome <eob> to xxx world of <eol> cyberharassment. <eol>
kind of harassment <eol> that women <eob> face in Pakistan is serious <eol> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This <eol> kind of <eob> harassment keeps women <eol> from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is # the sixth most populous country in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access <eol> to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the # rise xx new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is <eol> also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala <eol> Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eol>
Another aspect is where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their bodies; <eol> where men xxx allowed to # disrespect women <eol> and <eol> even kill them sometimes in the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where # women are xxxx to die <eob> right xxxxxxx their houses <eob> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in <eob> the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very # clearly: <eol> it's not <eob> honor; it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder. <eob>
I come from a very xxxxx village <eob> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are # allowed to pursue their xxxxxx education. <eol>
The elders <eol> of my xxxxxxxx family <eob> didn't allow their women <eol> to pursue their # education <eol> xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike other <eol> male guardians of my <eol> family, my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get xx law degree, of course, # it was really difficult, and [there # were] frowns of disapproval. <eol>
But xx end, <eob> I knew <eob> it's either me or <eob> # them, <eol> and I chose myself.
(Applause) <eol>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eol> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eol> phone until I was married. <eol>
And even when I xxx married, this tool xxxxxx x tool <eob> for my # own surveillance.
When # I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eol> he # really didn't approve of <eol> and threw me out of house, <eob> with my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eol>
And that was the # time <eob> when I first asked # myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eob> to enjoy the same equal xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution? <eob>
While the <eob> states that # a woman <eol> has same equal <eob> access to the information, <eol> why # xx it always <eol> men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> xxx # are granting these rights to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the <eob> law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided to take a step, <eol> instead of <eob> keep questioning <eob> these <eol> patriarchal and societal norms. <eob>
And founded the <eob> Digital <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to address all the issues <eob> and women's experiences in <eob> online spaces <eol> and cyberharassment.
From lobbying free and safe internet to convincing young women that access to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, right, <eol> I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a hope xx my heart, and to offer a solution <eob> to this menace, <eob> I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's <eob> first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support <eob> to the women <eol> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online.
I <eob> think of the xxxxx who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they unsafe in <eob> online spaces, <eob> and they go about their <eob> # daily activities, <eol> thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access # to the internet <eol> is access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I # fight <eob> for women's digital rights, I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at <eol> a critical moment. <eol>
leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eol> are failing <eob> us. <eol>
<eob>
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eol> but often, xxxxxxx us to the wrong objectives. <eol>
this is unacceptable. <eol>
This has xx stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going to # choose the right course?
It's not xxxxx to be easy. <eob>
For years, I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams they've # chosen <eob> the right objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eol>
Many have succeeded, others of <eol> them have failed. <eob>
And today # I'm going to share with you what really a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, how and <eol> they set meaningful and audacious xxxxxx <eob> the # <eob> right goals # for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've got a lot to learn, <eob> a computer engineer, <eol> I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest manager <eob> of his or xxx other <eob> era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eol> and he said to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you xxxxx
Execution xx what matters the most". <eol>
And so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and <eob> # Key Results". <eol>
kind xx rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And <eol> it's all about excellent execution.
So here's a <eob> classic video <eob> from the 1970s <eol> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management xx # systems <eob> xxx the <eob> objectives and xxx key results, <eob> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the xxx you can look <eol> and without any argument say, <eol> "Did I # do that, or did I do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key <eol> Results, <eob> or <eob> xxxxx <eob> are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, <eol> xxxx work for teams, <eol> they even work xxx individuals.
The objectives are <eob> what <eol> you want to have accomplished.
The key results are how I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's <eol> the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us are not setting <eob> goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations set objectives and # meet them.
They ship their sales, they introduce their <eob> new products, <eob> they make <eob> their numbers, <eob> but xxxx lack a sense of purpose <eol> to <eob> inspire their teams. <eob>
So how do <eob> you <eol> set <eol> these <eob> goals the right <eob> way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" Why?
Because truly transformational teams <eol> combine their ambitions <eob> to their <eob> passion and to their purpose, <eob> and they develop a # clear and compelling of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a called xxxxx
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when was # <eob> founded, they used data to serve the health <eob> needs <eol> of xxxx of xxxxxxx at large companies.
And then two years into the <eob> company's # <eol> life, the xxxxxxx government issued a <eob> proposal <eob> to <eob> build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll remember <eob> that Medicaid is <eob> that <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Nuna at the time was just 15 people this database had to xx built in one year, and they had a whole set of commitments xxxx they had to <eob> honor, <eob> and they weren't # going to make <eob> very money on the project. <eob>
This was a <eob> bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped <eob> at the opportunity. <eol> She did not <eol>
Why? <eol>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he <eob> was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
xx fell to the ground. <eob> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the <eol> country with limited resources <eol> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was <eol> up to Jini <eob> to xxxxxx family in Medicaid. <eob>
She # was nine <eob> years # old. <eol>
That moment <eob> defined her mission, and # that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on # <eob> that contract. <eob>
Here's <eob> Jini to <eob> tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: <eol> saved # my from bankruptcy, xxx today it # provides xxx health and for millions of others. <eol>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eol> whose story deserves <eob> to <eob> be told with # dignity.
JD: # And Jini's # story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # significant, <eol> they're action-oriented, <eob> they are <eob> inspiring, <eol> and they're a # kind of xxxxxxx <eob> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eol> would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eol> but for years, has <eob> used OKRs <eob> to # wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx ONE has focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives.
The first is debt relief <eol> for the poorest countries in the world. <eol>
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs. <eol>
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? # Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just listen # to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> xxxx you to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eob> a perfect rhyme <eob> with the head, <eol> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained # inside it. <eol>
It gives xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> failing is not a # fireable offense.
And <eol> when you have that <eol> sort of structure and environment and the right people, magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is <eob> right # around the corner. <eol>
This is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've <eol> covered the whys, <eol> with Bono the whats # of goal-setting. <eol>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, the hows are the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives.
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound.
They're xxxxxxxxxx but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those # are <eob> good key results. <eob>
In 1999, <eob> I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, <eol> Larry and Sergey. <eol>
# they are, <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
not quite. <eob>
What # he really said was, <eob> "We # have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eol> so we'll give it a <eob> go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I <eol> took that xx a kind of endorsement.
But every since then, <eol> every Googler has written # down <eol> her objectives her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used for bonuses or # for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eol>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's get collective commitment to # truly stretch goals.
In xxxxx a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eol> which was to build the next generation <eob> client platform <eol> the future web -- <eol> in other words, build the browser.
He was thoughtful about how he chose his key results. <eob>
How xx you measure the <eob> xxxx # browser?
It could # be # ad clicks or <eob> engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of users, because users are <eol> going to decide <eob> Chrome is a great browser or not. <eol>
he had <eob> this one <eob> objective: <eob> build # the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eol> numbers of users, <eob> but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, his goal # was <eob> 20 million <eob> users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second # year, he <eob> raised the bar to 50 <eob> million.
He # got to # 37 # million users.
Somewhat <eol> better.
In the third # year, he upped the # ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eol>
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, broader distribution, <eob> improved the technology, kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 <eol>
Here's why I # like this story, <eob> not so much for # the happy ending, <eob> but it # shows someone carefully choosing <eol> the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eob> year <eob> after year after <eol> year. <eol>
It's a # <eob> perfect story <eol> for a nerd like me. <eol>
Now, I think <eob> of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eob> that <eol> # are made from <eob> the whats <eob> and hows of our ambitions.
What really matters is the why <eol> that pour into those vessels. <eol>
That's why we xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eol>
They're not # going to be a substitute for a strong <eob> culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop.
I want you to <eob> think <eol> about your life for # a moment. <eol>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, your objectives and your # key results. <eob>
Do it <eol> today. <eol>
If <eol> you'd <eob> like some feedback on them, <eob> you can send # to # me. <eol>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If <eol> we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eol> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all <eob> the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eol> every one <eol> of those goals <eol> is today by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've xxxx called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eol> spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you <eol> to join me in <eob> this movement.
Let's xxxxx # for # what it is <eol> that really matters, <eol> because we can take xxxx <eol> beyond our businesses. <eol>
We can take them # to our <eob> families, <eol> to our schools, even to our # governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eol>
We # can transform # those informations. <eol>
We can get back on right track if xx <eob> can and do measure <eol> what really matters.
Thank # you.
(Applause)
What is <eob> history? <eol>
It is something written <eob> by the <eob> winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> Lenin or Trotsky. <eol>
As a result, <eob> people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> xxxx # at # history # as something <eob> that was predetermined or determined by the leaders, <eob> and xxxxxx people could not <eob> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians xxxxx # do not believe <eol> that # Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever will be # x truly democratic <eob> nation, and this <eob> is due to the way history has been framed to the <eob> citizens of Russia.
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years of my # life <eol> trying to <eob> go 100 years back, <eob> to year <eol> 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution.
I asked # myself, what <eol> if the internet and <eob> Facebook existed 100 years <eob> ago? <eob>
So last # year, we built <eob> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My team and I created software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all real diaries and letters <eob> written by # more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago.
So any user of our website <eob> or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow a news feed <eob> for each day of 1917 <eol> and read what people <eob> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin <eob> or Pavlova and others thought and felt. <eol>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people <eob> like # <eob> you and <eol> me, not demigods, <eob> and # we see that history consists <eol> of <eol> their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius ideas".
Our project was <eol> a shock for many Russians, <eol> used to that our country <eol> has always been an <eol> autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas xx freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because <eob> was not our destiny. <eol>
But if <eob> we take a broader # look, <eol> it's not that black # and white.
Yes, 1917 led to # 70 years <eol> of communist # dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we xxx that Russia <eob> could have had a different history <eob> xxx a democratic future, <eol> as any other country could or still <eol> can. <eol>
Reading the posts <eol> from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in world to abolish the death penalty, or one of first ones <eol> to grant women rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary # people influenced history <eob> can help us <eob> create # better <eob> future, <eob> because history <eob> is just # a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right <eob> now.
We do need new ways of telling history, <eol> and this year, for example, <eol> xx started a <eol> new <eob> online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary series that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, a year marked by global social # change <eol> that, in many ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now. <eol>
But we <eol> are making xxxx history alive by xx all the main <eob> xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a # lot individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges and were fighting for <eob> the same values, <eob> matter if they lived in the US or <eol> in USSR <eob> or in France or in <eob> China or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people power <eol> are not the only ones making choices. <eob>
That gives any user a possibility <eob> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people <eob> matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter.
Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers # matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eob>
We all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

Computer algorithms today are performing incredible tasks <eol> with <eob> high accuracies, at # <eob> a <eol> massive scale, using human-like # intelligence. <eob>
And intelligence of computers is # often referred xx as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eol>
AI is poised to an incredible impact on our lives <eob> in the future. <eol>
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive <eob> challenges in detecting diagnosing <eob> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as <eob> # infectious diseases and cancer. <eol>
Thousands patients every year lose xxxxx lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eol>
Our # way to these patients <eob> is # to perform early xxxxxxxxx <eob> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect # these <eob> diseases today, xxx # artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients # who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eol> an expert <eob> physician <eob> first orders very expensive <eol> medical imaging <eob> technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, CTs, MRIs, to be performed.
Once those images are collected, <eol> another expert <eob> physician then diagnoses those images and talks to <eob> the xxxxxxxx <eol>
As xxx can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive xxxxxxxx <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, and is <eob> not considered practical <eol> for the <eol> developing world. <eob>
And # fact, many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eol>
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using intelligence?
Today, if I <eol> were to use traditional <eol> artificial # intelligence to solve this problem, <eob> I xxxxx require 10,000 -- I repeat, on an order of 10,000 of these very medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eol>
After that, x would <eob> xxxx go <eol> to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eol> those images for me.
And using those <eob> two pieces of information, I <eob> xxx train a standard deep neural network or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis.
Similar xx # first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem.
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we # more scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial <eob> intelligence <eol> architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eob> problems facing # us today?
And this <eol> is exactly <eob> what my group at xxx Media Lab does.
We have invented a variety <eob> of unorthodox AI architectures to some of the most important <eob> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In <eob> the example I shared <eol> with <eob> you today, had two goals. <eol>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eob> required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eol> we wanted # to reduce <eol> the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging <eob> to screen <eob> patients. <eol>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, instead of starting <eol> with tens and thousands <eol> of these very expensive images, like traditional AI, we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and <eol> I <eol> figured out a clever way to extract billions <eob> of information packets. <eob>
These information packets <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry xxx rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical <eol> image. <eol>
In a sense, we converted one image <eol> xxxx billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for training. <eol>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce <eol> the use of expensive <eob> imaging technologies to screen # patients, <eob> we started with # a standard, xxxxx <eob> light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eol>
Then remember those xxxxxxxx of information packets? <eob>
We overlaid <eol> those from <eob> the medical image onto this image, creating something <eol> that we call x composite image. <eol>
Much to our surprise, we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- <eob> of these composite images to <eol> xxxxx <eob> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eol>
To summarize our approach, instead of # using 10,000 <eob> very expensive <eob> medical <eob> we # can now <eob> train the AI algorithms in an unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 # of these high-resolution, <eob> but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eol> and <eol> provide diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the and <eol> even right now, <eob> xxxx # very simple, white light <eob> photographs from the instead of expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we are to enter an era <eol> where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make an incredible <eob> impact xx our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should thinking about unorthodox artificial intelligence architectures, <eob> which can <eol> accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eob> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause)
What if you could take a pill or a <eob> vaccine <eob> and, just <eob> getting over # a cold, <eol> you heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, if we xxxx <eob> an operation or an accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, <eob> uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to <eol> give us <eob> the signals to grow tissues. <eol>
Just like vaccines <eob> instruct our body <eob> to # fight disease, <eob> we # could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues and <eob> more quickly heal wounds. <eol>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, but there are xxxxxxx organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat.
lizards can <eol> regrow their tails, the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, and even <eob> # us mere humans <eol> can regrow our # liver <eol> after xxxxxx more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions from the xxxxxx system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that annoying sinus infection, <eol> our immune system defends <eol> our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eol> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials that are currently being # tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help <eob> regrow muscle, <eol> our team noticed that <eol> after treating an injured # muscle with <eob> these materials, <eol> there # was a large number <eob> of immune cells in that xxxxxxxx <eol> the surrounding muscle. <eob>
So in this case, <eob> of # the immune cells rushing off <eob> towards to fight bacteria, they're rushing toward an injury. <eol>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eol> the helper T xxxxx <eob> was # present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, <eol> just like <eob> xxxx you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eol> and try and tape it back together again, <eol> we can heal, but # it might not be in # the most functional <eob> way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have these helper <eob> # T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops fat cells xxxxxx xx it, <eob> and xx there's fat <eob> in our muscle, <eob> it isn't <eob> as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eol> our body <eob> could grow back without these # scars <eob> and look like # what xx was before we were even injured. <eol>
I'm working <eol> to xxxxxx <eob> materials <eol> that <eol> give us # the signals <eol> to build new tissue by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know <eob> that <eol> xxx time <eob> a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the # immune <eob> system <eob> will <eob> respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers <eob> to insulin pumps <eol> to the materials that engineers are using <eob> to try and build new <eol>
So when I # place that material, <eob> or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system <eob> creates x small environment of cells and proteins <eol> that <eob> can change the <eob> way <eob> that our stem cells behave.
Now, like the weather affects # our daily activities, <eol> like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> xx entire TV xxxx on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that <eol> xxx stem cells grow and <eob> develop. <eol>
If we have the wrong signals, <eol> say the Netflix signals, we get fat cells instead of # muscle.
These scaffolds made of a variety of different things, from plastics to <eol> naturally derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that more or less <eol> porous, <eob> gels # of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers can even make the <eol> materials <eob> release different xxxxxxx over time. <eob>
So in other words, we <eob> can orchestrate <eob> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving # them the <eob> correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that # can be <eob> changed for different tissues, <eol> just <eol> like a producer would change <eob> the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eob> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eol>
I'm combining specific types of xxxxxxx <eob> that mimic how our <eob> body responds <eob> to xxxxxx to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx
Now, we aren't going to up tomorrow and xx able to heal like Wolverine.
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eol>
But with these advances, <eol> and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal <eob> wounds, we <eob> could begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eob> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eob> help us regenerate, and maybe one day be xxxx <eob> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>

So, xx a child, I xxxx # to spend all of my time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, I would dash across the floor <eob> and stick my face in front xx <eol> her only air <eol> conditioner. <eol>
But I <eol> didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eol>
Growing up, stories of next-door # neighbors <eob> having <eob> to # set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me.
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my <eob> neighbors would have no choice but to bypass the meter <eob> after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more xxxx <eob>
These kinds <eob> of dangerous incidents can take root when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eol>
In the average American spends <eol> three percent of # their income on energy.
In contrast, # low-income and rural populations <eol> can spend xxx even 30 percent of <eob> their income energy. <eol>
In 2015, this caused over <eob> 25 <eob> million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes.
This is when energy becomes <eol> a # burden.
xxx energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eol>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you <eob> take your child <eob> to get <eob> xxx flu medicine, or # do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and # every month, <eol> seven million <eol> people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and xxxxxxxx issue. <eol>
Families with high energy burdens are disproportionately people # of color, <eol> who spend more per foot <eob> than # their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans <eob> and even schoolteachers <eol> who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 million <eob> people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens have a greater xxxxxxxxxx of xxxxxxxxxx <eol> like heart and asthma. <eob>
Look <eob> -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we <eol> have the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is xxxxx
Cost of <eol> renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eol> are xxx decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we # cost parity, <eol> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than # xxx average American.
xxxx is why, when I was 22, I founded the # nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with # communities, <eol> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike xx provide equitable access <eob> to clean energy, energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eol>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eol>
I believe in the power <eob> of xxxxx communities, <eob> in the transforming effect of relationships. <eob>
So we start <eob> by working directly <eol> with the <eob> communities that have the highest energy burdens.
We host workshops <eob> and events for communities to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small updates to their homes <eol> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go long way to maximize efficiency.
We're connecting neighborhoods <eob> to # <eob> community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eob> smart home research <eob> and installation programs <eob> to help families bring down <eol> their energy <eob> bills.
even working directly with elected officials, <eob> advocating xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eol> because see this vision <eob> of energy equity and <eob> resilience succeed, <eol> have to work together sustainably. <eob>
US spends <eol> over three xxxxxxx # a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, but they're only able to help <eob> a fraction those in need. <eob>
In <eob> fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, xx assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into # our communities, we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy # that is clean, reliable and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, clean technology <eob> and energy efficiency <eol> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high xxxxxx burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make # ends meet.
xxxx # is life-changing.
This is <eob> an opportunity <eol> for # to # use their energy savings sponsor their future. <eob>
I <eob> think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors, <eol> the impossible choices <eol> that they had to <eol> make <eol> and the effect it had <eob> on our whole community. <eol>
But this is not just about them. <eol>
There millions nationwide having <eob> to # make the same impossible choices today.
And I know high energy <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but <eob> through relationships <eob> with communities and technology, we have the paths to them. <eob>
And when we do, <eol> we will all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eol>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of # birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't <eob> it fascinating?
What I find remarkable that # these birds <eob> would not be <eob> able to do <eob> that <eob> if they all would have to <eob> follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, <eob> scientists believe <eob> that these birds <eob> aligned on a few <eob> simple rules, <eob> allowing every single <eol> bird <eol> to autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Their alignment # enables <eol> their autonomy, and their autonomy <eob> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eob> with any one <eob> of us? <eol>
Well, it's one <eol> way <eob> of illustrating what <eol> I believe to <eob> be the most important xxxxxx that is needed in ways of working today.
The world is getting <eob> xxx more # complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, a way that creates <eob> around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make <eob> decisions # faster.
But the question is: In order to get there, <eol> what are we willing <eob> to give up? <eol>
A few years ago, I <eob> was <eob> xxxxxxx with <eob> a bank <eob> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They wanted their offering to be more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen <eob> a bank from the <eob> so me <eob> try to # illustrate what many traditional xxxxx look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to # <eol> go <eol> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers engineers, etc. <eol>
You see meetings with 20 people <eol> where # nothing decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They end up in PowerPoint parking lots.
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments.
Getting anything # can <eol> take forever.
So this bank knew <eob> that in <eob> order to transform, they would have <eob> to improve <eol> their <eol> time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well.
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to go and have a look at companies <eob> xxxx seem to # be more innovative, <eob> xxxx # Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And I remember how we were walking <eob> the halls at one these companies in December <eol> xxxxx <eol> a <eob> management consultant <eol> and team <eol> of # bankers. <eol>
We felt like <eob> xxxxxxxxx in a land, <eol> surrounded by <eob> beanbags and hoodies and lots of smart, creative employees.
So then we asked, <eol> "How your company organized?" <eob> And we expected to xxx an <eob> org chart.
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and <eob> "tribes" <eol> to how they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own <eob> world. <eol>
We asked, "How many xxxxxx are working for <eol> you?" <eol> "It <eob> depends". <eol>
"Who do you report <eob> to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
You can <eob> imagine our surprise. <eol>
xx <eol> were for what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles <eol> of organizations, <eol> their was, "It depends". <eol>
Now, the course of <eol> that day, <eob> we gained a better understanding <eol> of their model.
They believed in the power <eol> small, autonomous teams.
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team so they could design, build and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of others in the company. <eob>
did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
They had all the skills needed <eob> right there in the team. <eol>
Now, <eob> at the end of that <eol> we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started xx like their model, <eol> so we were already thinking of how <eob> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eob> a guy who had not said x xxxx all day, <eob> he <eol> suddenly said, <eob> "So I you like # our model.
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are willing to give up?" <eol> What were <eol> we # <eol> willing to give up? <eol>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> we knew he was right. <eob>
Change <eob> is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> xx some of the old <eob> as well.
Now, over xxx past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies all over the world <eob> to change their <eob> ways of working. <eob>
xxx clearly, every company <eob> has their own skeptics <eob> about why is not <eob> going to work for them. <eob>
xxxx # product is more <eol> or <eob> "They <eob> don't have xxx legacy IT like we <eob> do," or "Regulators just won't allow this in our industry". <eob>
But for this # bank and also for the other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change # was possible. <eob>
Within a year, <eol> xx <eol> completely xxxx up the old silos between marketing, <eob> product, channels and # IT. <eob>
Three # thousand employees <eob> were xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
xx instead of product people <eol> sitting just with product people <eol> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a product <eob> person and <eob> # an engineer <eob> xxxx now members <eob> of the same team. <eol>
You could be member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile banking app, etc.
At the <eob> go-live date <eol> of that new organization, <eob> some were <eob> shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eol> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other emails <eol> and <eob> status reports for the last 10 years. <eol>
You would # hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing answers". (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together every # day.
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get from <eob> xxx engineer <eol> who sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just xxxxxxx stuff done.
Now, getting there xx not easy. <eol>
as it xxxxx out, "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and down the organization, <eob> want the xxxx to
But to do so, we <eob> need all <eol> the skills <eol> expertise for <eob> that decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
this brings difficult trade-offs.
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eol> different cities or even <eol> different # countries today? <eob>
Or should we # <eol> invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eol>
And how do we ensure consistency in the way we do things <eob> across these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eol> xx management matrix. <eol>
Now, all these changes xx structure <eol> and and # -- <eol> they are not easy. <eol>
But in the end, <eol> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams to be xxxxx flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> xxxx have <eol> to <eol> be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders xxxxxxxxxx their people what to <eob> do, <eol> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers.
But xx xxxx xxxxx that each employee <eob> needs to xxxxxx a leader, regardless of their formal <eol> title.
It's about of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eol>
Now obviously, <eol> # also cannot # <eob> to <eob> have all these xxxxx <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because that would certainly lead chaos. <eob>
xx # we <eob> need alignment and <eob> # autonomy <eob> at the same time, <eol> just like flock of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new <eol> behaviors, <eob> and with # each new behavior, <eob> there is up on something old as well. <eol>
Leaders have to <eob> make sure <eob> that everyone the organization is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go <eob> and # trust their teams <eol> to xxxx xxx right decisions <eob> on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and transparent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But you know how say that is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if they're giving up <eob> that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eol> openly and transparently <eob> as well.
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo <eob> session <eol> to share <eob> output <eol> of what <eol> they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eol> each # member of the team gives an update <eob> of what they are working on individually.
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable for people, <eob> because suddenly, there is <eob> no place to hide anymore.
Everything do is for everyone. <eob>
xxx alignment is not easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eol> is not <eob> so obvious, either. <eol>
One executive at xxxxxxx company likes to explain how he used to <eol> be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at <eob> status reports, he needs to walk down xx the team <eob> floors <eol> to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx <eol>
And instead <eob> of telling people what <eol> do, <eob> he looks for ways # <eob> to help them. <eol>
That is radical change <eol> for xxxxxxx who used to be a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in the old world, this executive said, "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run over time and over <eol> budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I <eol> have <eol> # much <eob> more transparency, and I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if <eol> needed".
And middle managers need to change as # well. <eol>
First of all, without the handovers and the PowerPoint, there's less of a need <eob> for xxxxxx managers.
And in the old world, there was xxxx idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just xxxxxx orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other people, middle managers were <eol> xx become player-coaches.
So imagine, the last years, you have just been telling <eob> other people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, and some <eob> great <eob> people # <eol> leave the company. <eob>
the result is a new culture <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all xx this is hard work.
But # it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, they were used to deploying <eol> new product features <eob> a few times per <eob>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eob> and # xxxxxxx the handovers and the red tape, the <eob> whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, <eob> if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eol> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if # walking the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up. <eob>
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory
But at least with this xxx # model, <eob> they are # much <eob> xxxxxx prepared <eob> to respond # to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eob> and more complex, <eol> so we need to <eol> reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is xxx <eob> xx structure <eol> or or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eob> senior executives taking charge.
Leaders will be all <eob> of those <eol> in the # organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eol>
So the question is: What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank <eol> you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
A leader is <eob> steady, # firm, <eol> decisive, # unwavering.
Never let 'em xxx you sweat, <eob> have an answer. <eob>
[The Way We Work] My name is # Dan, I'm a partner at # a global creative consultancy.
But there's another side to <eol> me: Carrie Dragshaw, the character I <eol> xxxxxxx on Instagram. <eob>
As I <eol> thought my double <eob> life, I couldn't help but xxxxxx ...
When your xxxx self <eob> is a little <eol> nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to xxx
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years <eol> of my career, <eob> I thought there # <eob> one way to be x leader: decisive and serious. <eol>
But not me. <eob>
So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role: I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in my hand motions. <eob>
someone who gets <eob> really excited about things, <eol> so I'd temper that. <eol>
x had this little voice <eol> in my <eob> # head, telling me, "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had xxx well-intentioned <eob> adviser who said, <eol> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eob> And that's <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it".
Cut to: me in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016.
I up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, thinking friends <eol> would get a kick <eob> out of it. <eol>
And then, things got crazy.
The post went viral, and <eol> at first # it was pure # fun. <eob>
I started these incredible messages from people <eob> about happy it made them, how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, maybe this is the time to tell that little voice in <eol> my head to just xxxx <eob> up and let xxxxxx be me. <eob>
But then things got a little too big. <eob>
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eol> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eob> "What would my bosses think?
Would my coworkers still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients <eol> think?" <eol> I thought was # <eol> going to have to get a different job. <eob>
But something <eol> happened, <eol> something small.
I <eol> got a text from my boss, <eob> it wasn't <eol> long, it just said, <eol> "Wow, xxxxxxx <eol> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eob>
And it let me put <eol> that <eol> little, scared voice away <eob> and just # be excited <eob> about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked <eob> out. <eob>
That's the power of one xxxxxxx sometimes all it takes one <eob> ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, more playful with me, it was <eol> as if knowing this other side of me <eol> them permission to <eob> be more of themselves as # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that <eob> openness and vulnerability would actually decrease <eob> my standing with my team. <eob>
But xxxx done the opposite.
Two years <eob> in, I never imagined that this part of me # not just be embraced, <eol> but could actually help my <eol> career. <eol>
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, in an office xxxxx creativity valued <eob> and I xxx already pretty established <eob> in my when all <eol> of this started.
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't. <eob>
all <eob> of this has taught me so much <eob> about <eol> just importance <eol> of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to work. <eol>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eol> about what it takes <eob> be xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
There's no one kind of # way to <eob> be a leader. <eob>
It's <eol> about finding xxxx strengths <eol> and finding <eob> ways to amplify them.
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eob> I'd put on my perfect # mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eol> "Gosh, <eob> that xxx frustrating".
We can talk about challenges <eob> and struggles in an way, <eol> than everybody pretending <eol> that they're fine until it's too late.
Concealing an identity takes work. <eol>
Think of all the wasted energy <eob> spent pretending, wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, <eol> is that in this big <eob> study of covering, <eol> 93 percent of those who say they're doing it also believe their organization values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> xxx all of our strange inner voices <eob> have a long way # to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big xxxxxxxxxx <eol> between adapting and disguising. <eol>
And I think I learned that a little late.
Personally, I'm taking # all this <eob> as a call # to be the <eol> # ally <eol> who, <eol> like my # boss did for me, <eob> lets # people know that it's xx to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> have x disability <eob> or are deeply religious, see what it's like <eol> being your full self # at work.
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eol>
The basic problem <eob> with xxxxxxx in an <eol> office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
[The # Way We Work] <eob> Howdy, my name is xxxxx <eob> and I'm <eob> the CEO of Automattic, <eob> the company behind # WordPress.com, and xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

Our focus on distributed didn't happen accidentally.
It was a <eob> conscious <eob> choice <eob> the very beginning.
I don't use the <eol> word "remote," because <eob> it sets up expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and # <eol> some aren't.
I use the word "distributed" to describe <eol> what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eob> on an # equal playing field.
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to build a company. <eob>
The # <eob> key is # you have to <eol> approach # it consciously. <eol>
When we started <eob> WordPress, <eob> many of the first 20 hires were people <eob> I'd never met in person. <eol>
But <eob> we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted <eob> to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent intelligence are equally distributed <eob> throughout # the world. But opportunity is not. <eol>
In Valley, <eob> the big # tech companies <eol> fish <eob> xxxx essentially <eol> the same small pond or bay.
A distributed company <eob> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but <eob> lives in California, you can gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes xx and goes to sleep <eol> wherever <eol> they are <eol> in the world. <eol> They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture <eob> and a different <eob> lived experience. <eob>
At the base <eob> of the decision <eol> to go there's a desire to give # people autonomy <eob> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless xxxxxx <eob> in <eob> a role <eol> where # specific hours are important, you can make your own schedule.
Everyone <eol> can have a corner office, their windows, the food they want to eat, you can # choose when there's music <eol> and when there's <eol>
You xxx choose what temperature <eob> the room should be. <eob>
You # can save the time you'd spend commuting <eol> and put it into <eol> that are important to <eob> you. <eol>
A distributed workforce <eol> is # ideal for a technology company. <eob>
people often ask me, <eol> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what <eob> about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eob> you can <eob> do a few things <eol> to build distributed xxxxxxxxxxx
First: document everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy to make <eol> decisions in the moment, <eol> in the kitchen, in the <eol> hall.
if people work <eob> and some <eol> members of the team <eob> are having those conversations they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made <eob> without understanding the why. <eob>
Always <eol> leave x trail of you were and <eol> what you were thinking # <eob> about. <eob>
This allows others <eob> to pick up <eol> where you left off.
It allows people in <eob> different time zones <eob> to <eol> it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eol> people leaving and people <eol> joining. <eob>
Try # to # have as much communication as <eob> xxxxxxxx online.
everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the <eob> right tools.
There are so many <eob> apps and services <eol> that <eol> help <eob> with xxxxxxxxxx communication, video <eol> conferencing, <eob> project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # that <eob> changed how probably aren't objects anymore. <eol>
They're things you access <eol> through your computer.
So experiment with different tools that enable <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a office, <eol> you're in the same place <eob> 48 weeks out of the year and you <eol> might have <eol> three <eol> four weeks <eol> apart. <eob>
We xxx to # that: we come together <eob> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once a # year we do a <eob> grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eob> comes together for a <eob> week.
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary goal # is connecting people. <eob> We want <eob> to make <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, and they have <eob> a deeper connection with their colleagues.
When they work <eob> together <eob> the rest of the year, they # can bring together that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the final xxxxxxxxx give people the <eol> flexibility to make their own work environment. <eol>
Every person Automattic has a co-working stipend that they can put <eob> towards a co-working xxxxx <eob> or just to # buy coffee, so don't <eol> get xxxxxx out of the coffee shop. <eol>
One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together and rented a workspace on a fishing pier.
Each person who joins the company gets a home-office stipend.
This is money they can xxxxxx <eol> in getting the right monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for xxxxx <eol>
Today, there <eol> are xxxx a few companies <eol> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eob> I predict that 90 <eob> percent <eob> companies <eol> that are to be changing <eol> the course of the world <eob> going xx function this <eob> # way. <eol>
They will evolve to be distributed first, or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eol>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eob> xxxx people autonomy to live <eob> and work <eol> where # they feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully in whatever <eob> is that you're creating together.
