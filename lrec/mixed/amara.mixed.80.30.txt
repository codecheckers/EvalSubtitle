Now, # like xxxx a <eol> xxx you'd # xxxxx xxxx xxxxxx and try and back # together # <eob> xx can # <eob> xxx it xxxxx not xx <eol> # most xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and we'll get a <eob>
xx if xxxxx # xxxx # helper # x xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx healthy <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx # xxx and fat in our muscle, isn't xx strong. <eob>
Now, xxxxx xxx # immune system, <eob> xxx # xxxxx xxxx # back <eol> these # scars <eob> xxxx like what # xxx <eol> before we # were xxxx <eob>
I'm working # # create <eob> give us xxx signals # build xxx <eob> xx # the # immune # response. <eob>
We # any # time <eol> x material xx # implanted # body, <eob> the # immune xxxxxx xxxx respond # it. <eol>
This from pacemakers xx # pumps # that # engineers # xxx using <eol> xx # xxx # new xxxxxxx <eol>
when # that # <eol> material, <eol> or # scaffold, in the xxxxx <eob> the # system # <eol> a xxxxx environment # cells and xxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx can way <eol> that xxx <eob> # stem xxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Now, just # like xxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # daily # <eob> xxxx xxxxx <eol> for a xxx or xxxxxxx xxx binge-watching <eol> an entire # Netflix, <eob> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx of scaffold <eob> # xxx that <eol> # xxxx # cells # and xxxxxxxx <eol>

So in other words, we orchestrate <eol> xxxx <eob> # Broadway show xx cells xx giving them # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx cues and <eob> xxxx # be changed # different <eob> xxxx x producer would # change # # xxx <eob> xxx "Les # Mis" versus <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx of Horrors". <eob>

# # we # see <eol> x # scar-proof band-aid, moldable muscle filler <eol> or xxxx x # wound-healing # vaccine. <eob>
