Welcome to the world # of cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx of <eob> harassment women face xx # Pakistan is very <eol> and leads to # sometimes deadly <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's x # form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eol> mobile technologies, <eol> and 15 percent penetration. <eob>
And this number # doesn't seem # # go down <eol> with xxx rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eob>
But just xxx of Pakistan.
Another # aspect <eob> is where <eol> the twisted xxxxxxx of <eob> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are to disrespect women <eol> and even them xxxxxxxxx <eob> in the name of so-called "family <eob> where # women are left # die right # outside their houses <eob> for # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx <eob> in <eob> # xxx name of "family honor". <eob>
# me say very clearly: <eob> it's <eob> not honor; <eob> a # murder. <eol>
I come from a xxxx # small village <eol> xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
elders of xx family <eol> didn't allow # xxxxx women <eol> to xxxxxx their higher # education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx <eol> # the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eol> my father was # who really <eol> supported # my <eol> # <eol>
To get law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, # really difficult, <eob> and [there frowns <eol> of disapproval. <eob>
xxx the end, <eob> I xxxx <eol> it's either <eob> # me or xxxxx <eob> and chose myself. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx family's traditions <eol> and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to a mobile <eol> phone until married. <eob>
And even when <eob> I was married, <eob> this became a tool <eob> for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea <eob> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eob> and # threw me of xxx house, xxxxx my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eol>
And # that was xxx time <eol> when I xxxxx asked myself, <eob>
Why are # women not <eol> to enjoy xxx xxxx equal rights <eob> enshrined <eol> # in our # Constitution? <eob>
While # xxx xxxxxx # that a woman has xxx same # xxxxx xxxxxx <eob> the # information, <eob> why is it # <eob> always <eob> men xx brothers, <eob> fathers and <eol> -- <eob> who # are xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to <eob> us, effectively making # the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided to # take a step, <eob> instead keep questioning # patriarchal structures <eob> and <eob> societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital # Rights <eol> Foundation # in # <eob> 2012 to <eob> address all xxx issues <eol> xxx women's experiences <eob> in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eol>
From lobbying for xxxx and safe # internet <eob> convincing young women <eob> that access # to the safe internet <eol> is fundamental, basic, # human right, I'm trying <eob> # to play part <eol> xx igniting spark <eob> to address the questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eob>
With # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started <eol> Pakistan's <eob> xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eol> in December <eob> # 2016 -- <eol>

xx a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> some # of our great institutions <eol> xxx failing us. <eob>
xxxx <eob>
xx cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eol> xxx often, they've xxxxx us <eol> to the xxxxx objectives. <eol>
is unacceptable. <eol>
This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eol> to xxxxxx the right
xxx going to # be <eob> easy.
For # years, # I've worked with talented # teams <eob> and they've chosen xxx right objectives <eol> xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others <eol> of them have <eol> failed. <eob>
And today I'm <eob> going to # share with you what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- xxxxxx what's how and # <eob> they xxx meaningful # audacious goals, <eob> the xxxxx # goals <eob> xxx the right # reasons. <eob>
Let's # <eob> go # back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, # is # me. <eob>
I've got a to xxxxxx <eob> I'm x computer <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> I'm under # xxxx Grove, been called the manager <eol> of his # or any xxxxx era. <eob>
Andy was a leader <eol> xxx also a # teacher, <eob> and he # # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know. <eob>
Execution is xxxx matters the <eol>
And so # x # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off <eol> the xxxxxxx doesn't <eob> # it? <eob>
And it's <eob> all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eol>
So # here's # # classic video from 1970s <eol> xx professor <eol> Andy xxxxxx
(Video) # Andy Grove: # The xxx key # <eob> phrases <eol> xx the management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eol>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The # key results have to measured, <eob> the end you can look <eob> and without xxx argument say, "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's <eol> Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, <eol> are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system <eol> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work xxx teams, <eol> they <eob> even work for individuals. <eob>
xxx <eob> # are <eol> you want to have <eol> accomplished.
The key are # how I'm going to get # xxxx # done. <eol>
Objectives. Key <eob>
What and # how. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many xx us are setting # goals wrong, <eob> xxx most us <eob> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eob>
lot of organizations <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them. <eol>
They ship their xxxxxx <eol> they introduce their # products, <eob> they make <eob> xxxxx numbers, <eob> but <eob> # they lack a sense xx <eob> to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # you set <eob> these goals the right <eol>
First, # you must answer <eob> xxx "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because transformational teams <eob> combine their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion and to their purpose, xxx they develop # a clear <eol> and xxxxxxxxxx <eob> sense xx why. <eob>
I to you a story. <eob>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eob>
Her # name is Jini xxxx
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna is a health care company. <eob>
And when xxx founded, <eob> they used data # to serve the # health lots xx workers at large <eob>
And two years <eol> into the life, <eob> the # federal government issued a <eob> to build the first # ever <eob> cloud database <eol>
Now, xxxxxx # remember <eol> that is <eol> that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> xxx xxxxxx with disabilities. <eol>
Nuna at # the xxxx # <eob> xxx # just # xx <eol> xxx <eol> database <eol> had to be built # xx xxx year, <eob> and they xxx xxxxx set <eob> commitments <eol> they had to honor, <eob> xxx frankly, they <eol> weren't # going # xx make very <eol> much money on the <eob>
This # was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini # seized xxx <eob>
jumped # at # opportunity. xxx did not flinch.
xxxx
Well, xxxx a # xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism. <eob>
And # when he xxx seven, <eob> xx had xxx xxx seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eol>
# xxxx ground. <eol> He <eol>
Jini's are xxxxxx immigrants. <eol>
They came to # the xxxxxxx <eol> with # resources <eol> speaking <eob> little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it up # xx # xxxx to enroll family # in Medicaid. <eob>
was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her <eol> company, <eob> xxx that xxxxxxx bid on, won <eol> xxx delivered on that # contract. <eob>
Here's Jini # to tell # you xxxx
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eob> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today it provides for <eol> and millions of # others. <eob>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid. <eob>
Every # row of is a life <eob> whose story # deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us <eob> that compelling why <eob> can the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to have accomplished. <eob>
objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, <eol> they are <eob> xxx they're a # kind of vaccine <eob> xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You # think a rockstar <eob> be an <eol> unlikely xxxx of <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and Key <eol> Results, <eob> but for years, Bono # <eol> used xxxx <eob> to # xxxx # a global war <eol> xxxxxxx poverty and <eob> disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eob> has xxxxxxx <eol> on xxx really gorgeous, objectives. <eob>
The # first is xxxx # relief for the # poorest countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is universal access <eol> to drugs.
Now, why these good objectives? <eob>
Let's <eol> # go back xx # our # checklist. <eol>
Check. <eob> xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate? <eol>
How <eob>
# xxxxxxx does passion xxxx xxx # to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't # find a perfect # rhyme with the head, <eol> then # passion means <eob>
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eob> the chemistry # contained # inside # xxx <eob>
gives # us # for risk, for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable <eol>
And when xxx have that sort <eol> # structure xxx environment <eob> and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eob>
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eol> and magic # is right # the corner.
xxxx is perfect. <eol>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows.
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # <eob> key results. <eob> That's xxx # we meet # our
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound. <eol>
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx # realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
# xxx <eob> xxxx key # results. <eol>
In xxxxx introduced OKRs <eol> to <eol> # Google's cofounders, xxxxx <eob> and Sergey. <eob>
xxxx they are, <eol> # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eob>
he really xxxx was, <eob> "We don't <eob> any other way to manage this xxxxxxxx <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
And I took xxxx as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, <eol> every Googler has written down <eol> # objectives <eob> and xxx key <eol>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've xxxxxxxxx them for everyone to xxxx
these xxx xxxx <eol> for bonuses # or for promotions. <eob>
xxxxxxx # set # aside. <eob>
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eob> and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> xxxxx was to # build <eol> the next client platform <eob> the future of web applications -- <eob> in other xxxxx the browser. <eol>
# very thoughtful <eob> how # he chose <eol> his # key # results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eol>
could xx clicks # or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going to decide <eob> Chrome a # great or not.
So he had this # one <eol> three-year-long # objective: <eob> build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And then every # year <eol> he xxxxx to <eob> the xxxx # key # results, <eob> of users, he upped the # ante.
In the first year, <eol> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> and he missed it. <eol>
He xxx less <eob> than 10. <eol>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar # <eol> to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eol>
Somewhat <eob>
In the <eob> xxxxx # year, <eob> he the ante <eol> once # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx # an <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> improved # <eob> the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eob>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx <eob>
xxx I like story, <eob> not so # xxx the # xxxxx <eob> ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx carefully choosing the <eob> objective <eob> and then xxxxxxxx to it <eol> year # after xxxx after
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eob>
Now, I think of # OKRs as vessels xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eol> and xxxx of our # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters xx # the why <eol> that we xxxx into those # vessels. <eol>
That's why we do our work.
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eol>
They're not # going to be for a strong culture <eol> or # for <eob> stronger leadership, <eob> # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, <eol> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eol>
I # to think xxxxx xxxx # for a moment. <eob>
Do you # # right <eol>
xxxx xxxx xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do it xxxxxx
If you'd some feedback # them, <eol> you can send # to # me. <eol>
I'm john@whatmatters.com.
If think xx world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a # Nuna, xx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're # <eob> remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable xxxxxx <eol> high-quality for <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all xxx # information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eob> xx powered today by OKRs.
Now, I've been xxxxxx the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eob> according to # Andy Grove, <eob> xxx I want you to join # me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because we can # <eol> take xxxx <eol> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
We can take them to # families, <eol> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments.
those governments accountable.
We can transform # those informations.
We can back on the track <eob> if we can and # do measure <eol> what really xxxxxxxx <eob>
# you. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
What # history?
It is # something written by <eol> the winners. <eob>
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eob> should be # focused on xxxxxxx <eob> like # Lenin # or <eob>
xx a result, people <eol> xx <eob> many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something <eol> xxxx was predetermined <eob> or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and common <eob> people could not influence it in xxx way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia could been <eob> will a truly # democratic <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> # this <eob> is due # to the way <eol> history <eol> has been framed <eob> xxx # Russia. <eob>
And this is true. <eol>
To prove # it, # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx <eol> to xxx year <eol> the xxxx of the Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if internet <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx years <eob> # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx <eol> x social network xxx dead # people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and x created # our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded <eob> all possible # real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 xxxxxx <eob> 100 ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or <eob> can # follow a xxxx feed <eol> for each day 1917 <eob> xxx read what people <eol> xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, <eol> xxxxx xx # Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eob> being xxxxxx like you and me, <eob> xxx demigods, <eol> # we see that history # <eol> of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxxxxxx # <eol> was a for many Russians, <eob> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx <eob> has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and <eob> democracy <eob> could # never have prevailed, <eob> just # <eob> because xxxxxxxxx <eol> was xxx our destiny. <eob>
xxx if we <eol> # take broader <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, # xxxx # led to <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But this project, we # xxx that Russia <eol> have # had a # different history and a <eob> xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the posts xxxx # <eob> you <eol> learn that Russia <eol> xxx the # first # country # in the <eol> to abolish the death penalty, or xxx of the xxxxx # ones to grant women # voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced # history <eob> can help a better <eob> because history is just a rehearsal <eol> what's happening xxxxx now.
We xx need new telling history, <eob> and xxxxx xxx example, <eob> we started # <eob> a new online # project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> xxx that # is # an online series that # you an impression <eol> of year, <eob> a # year by social change <eol> that, many ways, <eol> the # world as we xxxx it
But we # making that history xxxxx <eol> by xxxx if xxx <eob> the main <eol> could xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals <eob> were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting for the values, <eob> no if they lived in <eob> US or in <eob> USSR <eob> or xx France or xx # China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By xxxxxxxx history <eol> in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, through # media, we show that people <eob> in # <eol> are not the only ones xxxxxx choices.
gives any user a possibility <eol> xx reclaiming <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>

Today, however, <eol> we still face xxxxxxx challenges <eob> in <eol> detecting and <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eol>
of patients every xxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> due to xxxxx and # oral cancer. <eob>
best # way to # help these patients <eob> is to # perform early # detection <eol> and diagnoses of these # diseases. <eob>
So how do # we detect today, <eol> and can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> help? <eob>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first <eol> expensive medical imaging # technologies <eob> xxxx as imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, xxxxxxx expert physician then diagnoses <eob> # talks xx # the patient. <eob>
As you # xxx see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, xxxxxxxxx # <eol> # expert # physicians, <eol> expensive imaging technologies, <eol> xxx # is not # considered practical the developing xxxxxx <eol>
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized # nations, xx <eob>
So, <eol> can we solve # this # problem <eob> using artificial intelligence? <eob>
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional <eob> artificial <eol> intelligence # architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> repeat, on an order # <eob> of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eol> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After <eob> xxxxx I would then # go <eob> an expert <eol> would # then analyze those <eol> images for # me. <eob>
And # using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx I can # a # standard deep neural network <eol> or <eob> a deep learning to # provide # xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Similar to the first approach, <eol> traditional artificial approaches <eol> suffer from the same # <eol> problem. <eob>
xxxxx # amounts xx xxxxx # expert # <eob> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more <eol> valuable <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these important problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eob> what xx group # at MIT Media xxxxx <eol>
We variety <eol> xx unorthodox # <eob> AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx solve xxxx xx the most important challenges facing us # in medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In the # example I shared <eol> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required to train artificial intelligence <eob> algorithms. <eob>
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eob> we wanted xx <eol> # reduce <eol> of medical <eol> imaging <eob> technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eob>
So how did we do it?
our first goal, xx starting <eol> xxxx # tens and thousands <eob> these very expensive medical images, <eol> xxxx traditional <eob> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx <eob> xxxx image, my team and I <eol> figured out a very clever # way <eob> to extract # billions <eol> xx information packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering <eol> # of xxxxxxx <eol> on the # medical image. <eob>
In a # we # one image xxxx # billions xx training data points, <eob> massively reducing xx data needed for <eob>
xxx our goal, <eob> to # the # use of # expensive medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eol> we started with a standard, <eol> white light acquired either # from a # <eol> camera <eol> or x mobile # phone, xxx the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions # of information # packets? <eob>
xx overlaid xxxxx from xxxxxxx image onto # this image, <eob> something <eol> that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much to xxx surprise, we xxxx required -- <eob> I only 50 -- <eol> these images # <eob> our algorithms # xxxx # efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, instead <eob> of using # <eol> very medical # images, we now train the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> using 50 of these high-resolution, but standard # <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and # xxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and provide xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eob> in <eob> the future and even right now, some very simple, # white light <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx from the <eob> instead # of expensive medical imaging technologies. <eol>
I <eol> believe that # xx # <eol> to enter xx # era <eob> where artificial intelligence is going to make <eol> impact # on xxx # future.
And x think that thinking <eol> xxxxx traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eob> about # unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which can accept xxxxxxx of data and xxxxx some xx the most xxxxxxxxx <eol> problems facing # us today, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx in health care. <eob>

Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and break your xxxxxx <eob> xxx try xxx <eol> tape it together again, <eob> we can heal, <eol> but it not be <eob> in xxxx # functional way, <eob> # we'll get a <eob>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, <eob> xxx muscle <eol> fat cells inside <eob> of it, and # if there's # fat in # our muscle, <eob> isn't as <eob>
Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eob> xxx body # grow back <eol> without <eol> # <eob> scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even <eol> # <eob>
I'm working to create <eob> that give xx # the signals <eol> to new tissue <eob> by # the immune response. <eol>
We know that # time <eol> a <eob> # material is xxxxxxxxx # body, <eob> the immune <eob> # xxxxxxx # xx # it. <eob>
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers <eob> to # and # xxxxx new <eob>
when I place material, <eob> scaffold, in the body, <eol> the immune system # creates <eol> small # environment of cells and <eob> proteins <eob> xxxx can change xxx # way <eob> that # our stem <eol> cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eob> our xxxxx # activities, <eob> like going for a run <eol> or inside binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that our # stem cells # xxxx # and # develop. <eob>
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eob> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eob> we get xxx cells instead of muscle. <eob>
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eol> of a variety of different # <eob> plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, that are more or less porous, <eol> gels different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even xxxx materials <eob> release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So # in xxxxxx # orchestrate <eob> xxxxxxxx show cells <eob> xx # giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props # can # be changed # for different tissues, <eob> just # like a producer xxxxx change the set <eob> for <eol> # "Les # Mis" versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eol>
xxx combining specific # of signals <eob> that xxxxx our body to injury <eob> to help us # regenerate. <eol>
the xxxxxxx <eob> we could see a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eol> a moldable filler <eob> even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't # to wake up xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx xx able to heal Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next # Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these <eob> # advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx # with our immune system <eol> to help and heal wounds, could xxxxx xxxxxx <eol> products # the market <eol> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eol> xx # help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe day be # able # keep pace xxxx a salamander. <eob>

So, as # a child, <eob> I used # to spend # of xx # time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, # humid, summer # days, I dash # the # <eob> floor <eol> and xxxxx my xxxx front <eob> # of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize that that experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> a privileged # xxx xxx community. <eol>

During the winter, struggling to get xx xxxxxxxxx would xxxx no choice <eol> but # to # <eob> the <eob> after their heat # was xxxx off, <eob> xxxx # keep their # family <eol> comfortable one # day. <eob>
These xx dangerous <eob> incidents # can take root <eol> when people are # xxxxx with choices. <eob>
In the US, xxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx <eob> percent of their # income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and rural xxxxxxxxxxx can spend # 20, even xx percent of <eob> their income on xxxxxxx
2015, xxxx caused over <eol> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> xx provide power <eol> to # their homes.
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden. <eol>
xxxxxx burdens are # so xxxx <eol> xxxx just x number. <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to her # flu medicine, <eol> xx do # you feed her? <eob>
Or <eob> do you # keep her <eob>
xxxx an choice, <eob> and # month, <eob> seven people choose between medicine # and energy. <eob>
This a xxxx # larger <eob> and systemic xxxxxx <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people xx color, <eol> who spend xxxx xxx xxxx <eol> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eol> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass of 37 <eob> million xxxxxx # a xxxx who are xxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx energy <eob> for # xxxxx most basic <eol> needs. <eob>
As a result, those # with <eol> high energy # burdens <eol> have # a greater likelihood # <eob> of conditions <eol> like # heart disease and <eob> # asthma. <eob>
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx <eob> Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have the tools to # xxxxxxx <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eob>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology <eob> are # decreasing. <eob>
even <eob> as we the majority of xxxxx who <eob> own <eol> # much more # than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when # I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
# is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, <eob> utilities <eob> and # xxxxxxxxxx alike provide <eol> to # energy, <eol> energy energy technology. <eol>
But # there's no one way to solve this. <eol>
I believe in # the xxxxx <eol> of # local in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect of relationships. <eob>
So xx by working directly <eol> the communities <eob> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx
We host <eol> and events # for communities <eob> to <eol> # xxxxxx poverty, <eol> and how making even <eol> updates to their homes like xxxxxx insulation windows <eol> and heaters <eob> # go # <eob> x long way <eob> # xx # maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting <eob> to community # solar <eob> and spearheading community-led smart # home research <eob> and # installation xxxxxxxx <eol> to help families bring # down their # bills. <eob>
We're <eob> xxxx working # directly <eol> with elected # <eob> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of # energy <eob> and resilience <eob> we have <eol> to xxxx together sustainably. <eob>
Now, <eob> the US # spends <eol> over # three billion a year <eob> energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eol> millions <eob> # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they're only able xx help <eob> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eol> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy equity <eob> and resilience <eob> into our communities, <eob> we can assure and impartial access <eob> to energy that clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At # scale, microgrid technology, xxx energy efficiency <eob> dramatically # improve xxxxxx health. <eob>
And for those xxxx # high burdens, <eob> it xxx <eob> help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent xx their income -- <eob> xx # percent of a person's income <eol> struggling to make xxxx # meet. <eob>
xxxx is life-changing. <eob>
This is <eol> xx <eol> for # use # their energy <eob> savings <eob> to sponsor <eob> their future. <eob>
I xxxxx <eol> # back to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eob> xxx impossible <eob> choices <eob> xxxx # they xxxx <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on xxxxx <eob>

And # high energy burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but through relationships <eol> with communities technology, we have # the <eob> paths to overcome them. <eob>

But # the # question is: <eob> In # order # to # get there, <eol> are <eob> xx # willing to # xxxx <eob> up? <eob>
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eob> that wanted to # embark <eob> a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their offering to be # <eol> intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm xxx sure how many of you <eol> # a # bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to <eol> illustrate <eob> # xxxx <eob> traditional banks like. <eob>
You <eob> see lots # of people # suits taking elevators xx go <eol> to department, sitting with marketers, <eob> xxxxxxxxx with engineers, # etc. <eob>
You see meetings # 20 # people <eob> nothing gets <eob>
Great xxxxxx They end up <eob> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eob>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx <eol>
this # xxxx <eol> xxxx in to transform, <eol> would have xx <eol> # improve <eol> time to market <eob> by changing <eol> their ways xx working as well. <eol>
But xxxx <eob>
To # get inspiration, <eob> # xx xxxxxxx to xxx have x look companies that seem # to xx more innovative, <eol> like Google, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And remember how we xxxx # <eol> the halls at xxx xx these # companies <eob> in # December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx and a xxxx # xx bankers. <eob>
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eob> surrounded # by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx
So then we # asked, <eol> xxxx # is # your company organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx to # get org # chart. <eob>
But <eob> instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny # names like # <eol> and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx explain how xxxx were organized. <eol>
So then tried to # <eob> that # our own world. <eob>
We # xxxxxx "How <eob> many # people <eol> are xxxxxxx for <eob> you?" "It depends". <eol>
"Who <eob> you xxxxxx to?" <eob> depends". <eob>
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" <eob> xxx <eol> depends".
You can our surprise. <eol>
xx were # <eob> xxxxxx for what we thought <eol> xx the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx
Now, over the # course # <eob> of that day, <eob> we gained understanding <eol> of # <eob>
They believed in xxx power <eol> of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like # <eol> mini-start-ups. <eob>
They xxx product people <eob> engineers in the same team <eob> so they could # design, build and # test ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eol>
xxxx # did not <eol> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They all the skills needed <eol> there in <eol> the team. <eob>
xxxx # at end of that day, <eol> xx <eob> had a <eol> to reflect xx what we <eob> # had learned. <eob>
And we started to # xxxx # their <eol> so # we already thinking xx how <eol> xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eol>
then, one # of the hosts, <eol> guy # who # had not # said a word # all # <eob> he suddenly xxxxx xxx <eol> x see you like xxx model. <eob>
But I # have one <eob> for # <eol> you: <eob> What # are <eob> you to give xxxx <eol> we willing # to give up? <eob>
xxx not # xxxx # an answer immediately, <eol> xxx we # knew # xx was right.
Change is only about <eol> xxxxxxxxx the <eol> xxxx <eob> it's about giving <eol> some of old as well. <eob>
Now, over <eol> # the # past years, <eol> I worked with companies <eol> all # xxxx <eob> # the world <eob> to change their xxxx xx # <eol> working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has xxx skeptics <eob> about why this is <eob> xxxxx xx for them. <eob>
"Our # is more complex," <eol> or # have <eol> the xxxxxx # xx # like we xxxx <eol> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our # industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx bank and also <eob> for the other companies <eob> xxxx x # have worked with <eob> change was possible. <eob>
a <eob> year, # we <eol> up old silos <eob> between # marketing, <eol> product, channels and xxx <eob>
Three # employees # <eol> were <eol> into 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # teams.
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just with # people <eob> engineers engineers, <eol> x product # person and an engineer <eol> xxxx now xxxxxxx of <eob> xxx xxxxx <eob>
You could be a xxxxxx of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for xxx <eob> mobile # banking app, xxxx <eob>
At the go-live date <eob> of xxxx new organization, <eob> people were xxxxxxx hands <eob> for # very # xxxxx # time, <eob> only to find xxx xxxx been <eob> xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from # each other <eol> but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # reports for last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone <eob> saying, <eob> "Ah, you're # the guy # that I <eol> xxxxxx chasing for <eob> answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee <eol> xxxxxxxx every
If the product guy has an <eol> idea, <eol> he can just # raise # it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eol> xxx # is # sitting right next # to him.
They xxxxxx test <eol> with customers immediately # -- <eol> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, <eob> # no xxx <eol> tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# <eob> getting there is not # easy. <eob>
And # it # turns out, <eol> are # you willing to give up?" <eob> is # exactly # right # to xxxx <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
xxxxxxx # of going up xxx # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx want # xxx team to # decide.
xx do we need xxx the skills <eol> and for xxxx in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eol> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eol> different xxxxxxxxx # today? <eol>
xx should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing?
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things <eol> across # xxxxxx <eob>
We still need some xxxx <eol> of management xxxxxxx
# these changes to structure <eol> and process procedure -- <eol> they <eol> xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> x found the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let xx try to illustrate. <eob>
If we # these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, # how # xxx <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But # it also # each employee <eol> needs to become leader, <eob> regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title.
It's # about all of # us up <eob> to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford to have all # teams <eol> xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx because # that would <eol> certainly lead # to chaos.
# we need and # autonomy <eol> at # same <eob> just xxxx a flock # of birds. <eob>
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, and <eob> # each new behavior, <eob> there xx <eol> on <eob> something as # well.
Leaders have to # make sure xxxx everyone # in xxx organization is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose the why and the -- what.
But # then xxxx xxxx let go # trust their # teams to <eob> the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to <eob> get # there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eol>
But you <eob> know <eob> # how say <eol> that information is a source of xxxxxx <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information may feel as # if <eol> they're giving up xxxx power.
xxx it's # not just <eob> managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well.
these # the # xxxxx <eol> typically work in short # sprints, and at the end # # sprint, <eol> they organize # a demo session <eob> xx share # the output <eol> of # what they've done, transparently. <eob>
xxxx <eob> each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working <eol> xx <eob>
Now, all this transparency be uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eol> xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eol>
Everything xx # do <eob> xx transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eob> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive # at # another company <eob> to explain he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eob> instead of looking at # status reports, he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # the <eob> team floors <eol> attend one of their sessions. <eob>
xxx instead of # telling people what xx <eob> looks # ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change <eob> for # someone # who used # xx be <eol> master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eob>
In xxxxxxxx <eob> many # projects would run over time and over budget, anyway.
xxx I have # more # transparency, <eol> I can course-correct <eol> much # earlier if needed". <eol>
And managers <eol> need to # change as well. <eob>
First # of all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was <eol> this idea of thinkers and #
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx instead xx only <eol> managing other # people, <eob> middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches. <eob>
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been <eob> other people what to xxx <eob> but now xxxxxx <eob> expected <eol> to # # # <eob> again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is <eob> not for everyone, <eol> and great people # leave the # company. <eob>
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy.
xxx of this is hard <eob>
xxx # it's worth it.
xxx companies that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx new # features # few times <eob>
xxx they have releases every few # <eob> # <eob> without # xxxxxxxxx <eob> the xxx tape, whole xxxxxxxxxxxx becomes more efficient. <eob>
And # if you walk the # halls <eob> xx these today, <eol> you just feel a new energy.
It # feels as if you're <eob> # xxxxxxx <eol> the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to # respond to <eob>
xxxxx is getting faster <eol> and more # xxxxxxxx <eob> so we # need # to reboot # <eob> our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change <eol> is not # structure <eob> or process # <eob> and xxxx also not <eol> senior taking charge. <eob>
Leaders xx all of those <eol> in # the organization <eob> who embrace <eol> the change. <eob>
all have # to lead the # change. <eob>

xx long as they can find good # <eob> Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was <eob> a conscious choice <eob> from the very # beginning.
Notice x don't xxx xxx word # "remote," because it sets up the expectation, <eob> xxxx some are essential <eob> and some aren't.
use xxx <eob> word <eol> "distributed" xxxxxxxx # what we do, <eob> where everyone xx <eol> on # xxxxxxx field.
I think a # distributed workforce <eob> is # most effective xxx <eol> to # company. <eob>
The key is you have to # consciously. <eob>
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, <eob> many of # xxx first # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years.
I # wanted to continue xxxx <eol> for one # reason. <eob>
I believe # that talent and <eob> are equally distributed <eol> the world. <eob> is # not.
In the tech xxxxxxxxx fish xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> the # same # small or xxxx
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx <eob> fish from # the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone <eol> # <eob> who # grew up <eol> in xxxxx <eol> # but lives in California, # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are xx # world. <eob> They bring a # <eol> understanding # of xxxx # culture <eol> and # a different lived experience.
At the base of xxx decision <eol> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # <eob> how # xxxx do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, you can make your # own schedule. <eol>
Everyone have a xxxxxx office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eol> you # can choose there's music <eob> xxx when silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx <eol> the xxxx should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> spend <eol> commuting and put xx into <eol> things <eob> that important xx <eol>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is ideal a # company. <eol>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, <eol> "This works for y'all, xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # an # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx # do # few xxxxxx <eob> to # <eob> build distributed
First: document <eob> everything. <eob>
In xx <eol> it's easy <eol> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, in the kitchen, # in xxx
But if # <eob> people work remotely <eol> and some members of the team <eob> are having conversations <eol> they xxxxx xxxx access <eob> they'll these xxxxxxxxx being made without understanding the xxxx <eob>
Always <eob> leave x trail # of xxxxx you <eob> were <eol> and what xxx were thinking about. <eob>
This # allows others <eob> pick xx <eol> you # left off. <eob>
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eob> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> it's great to think as # an organization <eob> people and xxxxxx <eob>
have as much communication <eob> as possible xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows # people <eob> up <eob>
You xxxx xxxx to find xxx # <eob>
There xxx so xxxx apps and xxxxxxxx that help # with <eob> day-to-day communication, <eob> xxxxx <eob> conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The things # <eob> that changed how # you xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx <eol> aren't objects # anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So xxxxxxxxxx with xxxxxxxxx <eol> tools that enable # collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face # time. <eob>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place <eol> xx weeks out of the year <eol> and you # might three four # xxxxx apart. <eob>
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> a # year xx # do a grand <eob> # <eob> xxxxx xxx entire company comes for a week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is <eob> people. <eob> xxxx to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on xxxx page, and <eob> xxxx xxxx # a deeper <eob> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # <eol> the rest xx the year, <eob> they can bring together <eol> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy. <eob>
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xx their # own work environment. <eob>
Every person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> xxxx put <eob> towards a co-working # xxxxx <eol> or to buy so # they don't <eol> out of xxx coffee shop. <eob>
One # in Seattle <eol> xx pool their stipends together <eol> and rented a # on x xxxxxxx pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eol> gets x home-office stipend. <eob>
xxxx # is money can <eob> invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # <eol> right # chair, monitor, <eob> # right xxxx so # <eob> they can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eol>
Today, <eob> there are just <eol> a # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx <eob>
In a decade or # xxxx <eol> x predict that 90 percent of companies <eol> that are to be # changing the # course of xxx xxxxx <eob> are going function way.
They will to be distributed # first, <eob> or # they'll # be replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx xxxxx <eob> what you're # going xx xxxxx next, consider xxx # you can tap <eol> into # global talent, <eob> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work <eol> where they # feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully whatever it # is you're <eol> creating together. <eob>
