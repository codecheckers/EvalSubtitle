For <eol> our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx tens # xxx <eob> of these # xxxx expensive images, <eob> like # AI, <eob> we # started # xxxx # a xxxxxx # medical image. <eob>

Then # xxxxx billions <eob> # of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
overlaid those # from <eol> medical # # this image, <eob> creating # <eol> that we call # x <eob> # composite image. <eob>

Now, xxx not <eob> sure how of xxx xxxx # a bank the inside, so let # me # try illustrate <eob> xxxx # xxxx traditional # banks # look # like.

this bank <eob> that in xxxxx # transform, <eob> they # would have to improve <eol> xxxx <eob> to <eob> # market <eob> by drastically changing xxxx <eol> xx xxxxxxx well. <eob>
But <eob>
xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx go and have # a # at # companies <eol> xxxx <eob> # to be # more innovative, <eob> like Netflix, xxxxxxx <eob>
And remember # were xxxxxxx the halls # one xx # companies <eol> in xxxxxxxx xxxxx <eol> a management # <eol> xxx a xxxx # of bankers. <eob>
xx felt # like xxxxxxxxx # xx a strange xxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # hoodies <eob> xxx # lots of xxxxxx creative employees. <eol>
then asked, <eol> "How xx your xxxxxxx <eol> And we expected an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx xxxx used strange <eol> # drawings <eol> with funny like # <eol> and # and xx explain how # they # were
So xx tried to translate <eol> to xxx own xxxxxx <eob>
xx xxxxxx # "How xxxx xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx for # xxxxx <eob> "It depends". <eob>

xx xxxx asking # # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxx of xxx # basic # principles of and xxxxxx was, # <eol> "It depends". <eol>
Now, # xxx xxxxxx that <eob> # gained # a xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx # of # model. <eob>
believed in # the <eol> of autonomous xxxxxx <eob>
xxxxx # xxxxx # like mini-start-ups. <eol>

xxxx xx # the of that <eol> # had # x xxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxxx xx # what we xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And had # to # xxxx their xxxxxx <eob> so xx were already # xx <eol> to apply of # xxxxx # xxxxx a <eob> bank. <eob>
xxx # xxxxx # one # xx the # <eol> a who had not said a all <eob> xx # xxxxxxxx xxxxx "So I see you # # our model. <eob>

Within a year, # we completely <eol> xxxx up the # # silos <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, # channels # <eob>
