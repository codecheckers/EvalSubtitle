Welcome to the world # of cyberharassment.
xxxx of harassment women <eol> face xx # Pakistan is very <eob> and leads to # sometimes deadly <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's x # form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eol> mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 percent penetration. <eob>
And this number # doesn't seem # # go down <eol> with xxx rise of new # <eob> technologies.
Pakistan also the birthplace <eol> of the <eob> youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eob>
But just xxx of Pakistan. <eob>
Another <eol> # aspect is where <eol> the twisted xxxxxxx of <eob> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are to disrespect women <eob> and even them xxxxxxxxx <eob> in the <eob> name of so-called "family where # women are left # die <eol> right # outside their houses <eob> for # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx <eob> in # xxx name of "family honor". <eob>
# me say very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eob> a # murder. <eob>
I come from a xxxx # small village <eol> xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eob> where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx
elders of xx family <eol> didn't allow <eol> # xxxxx women to xxxxxx their higher # education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx # the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was # who really <eol> supported # my # <eob>
To get law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, # really difficult, <eob> and [there frowns of disapproval. <eob>
xxx the end, I xxxx <eol> it's either # me or xxxxx <eob> and chose myself. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx family's traditions and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to a mobile <eol> phone until married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eob> this became a tool <eol> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eol> and # threw me of xxx house, <eob> xxxxx my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time <eob> when I xxxxx asked myself, <eob>
Why are # women <eob> not <eob> to enjoy xxx <eol> xxxx equal rights <eob> enshrined # in our # Constitution? <eob>
While # xxx xxxxxx # that a woman <eol> has xxx same # xxxxx xxxxxx <eob> the # information, <eob> why is it # always men xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eob> who # are xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, <eob> effectively making # the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to # take a step, <eob> instead keep questioning <eol> # patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital # Rights <eol> Foundation # in # 2012 <eob> to address all xxx issues <eol> xxx women's experiences in online <eol> spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for xxxx and safe # internet <eol> convincing young women <eob> that access # to the safe internet <eob> is fundamental, basic, # human right, <eob> I'm trying # to play part <eol> xx igniting spark <eob> to address the questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eob>
With # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December # 2016 -- <eob> <eob>
to support xxx # xxxxx who # xx know who to xxxx to <eob> when # they face serious threats online. <eob>
I of the women # who do xxx have <eol> the necessary to deal the mental trauma <eol> # feel unsafe in online # <eob> xxxx <eob> go xxxxx their xxxxx activities, <eob> thinking xxxx there # <eol> # rape # threat in # their in-box. <eob>
Safe # access to <eol> xxx internet <eol> is xx access to knowledge, <eob> and is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's rights, xxx fighting xxx equality. <eob>

(Applause) <eob>
xx a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> some # of our great institutions <eob> xxx failing us. <eob>
xxxx <eob>
xx cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> xxx often, they've xxxxx us <eol> to the xxxxx objectives. <eob>
is unacceptable. <eob>
This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eol> to xxxxxx the right <eob>
xxx <eob> going to # be easy. <eob>
For # years, # I've worked with talented # teams <eob> and they've chosen xxx right objectives <eol> xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to # share with you <eob> what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> xxxxxx what's <eob> how and # <eob> they xxx meaningful # audacious goals, <eob> the xxxxx # goals xxx the right # reasons. <eol>
Let's # go # back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, # is # me. <eob>
I've got a to xxxxxx <eol> I'm x computer <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> I'm <eob> under # xxxx Grove, <eob> been called the manager <eol> of his # or any xxxxx era. <eob>
Andy <eob> was a leader <eol> xxx also a # teacher, <eob> and he # # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know. <eol>
Execution is xxxx matters the
And so # x # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off <eol> the xxxxxxx doesn't # it? <eob>
And it's all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eol>
So # here's # # classic video from 1970s <eob> xx professor Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) # Andy Grove: # The xxx key # phrases <eol> xx the management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The # key results have to measured, the end you can look <eol> and without xxx argument say, <eob> "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple.
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system <eob> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work xxx teams, <eob> they even work <eob> for individuals. <eob>
xxx # are <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key are # how <eol> I'm going to get # xxxx # done. <eob>
Objectives. Key <eol>
What and # how. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many xx us are setting # goals wrong, <eol> xxx most us <eol> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eob>
lot of organizations <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them. <eob>
They ship their xxxxxx <eol> they introduce their # products, <eob> they make xxxxx numbers, <eob> but # they lack a sense xx <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # you set these goals the right <eob>
First, # you must answer <eol> xxx "Why?" <eob> Why? <eol>
Because transformational teams <eob> combine their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion and to their purpose, <eob> xxx they develop # a clear <eol> and xxxxxxxxxx sense xx why. <eob>
I to you a story. <eob>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eol>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna is a health care company. <eob>
And when xxx founded, <eob> they used data # to serve the # health <eol> lots xx workers at large <eob>
And two years <eob> into the life, the # federal government issued a <eob> to build the first # ever <eol> cloud database <eob>
Now, xxxxxx # remember <eol> that is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> xxx xxxxxx with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at # the xxxx # xxx # just # xx <eob> xxx database had to be built # xx xxx year, <eol> and they xxx <eob> xxxxx set commitments <eob> they had to honor, <eob> xxx frankly, they weren't # going # xx make <eol> very much money on the <eob>
This # was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini # seized xxx <eob>
jumped # at # opportunity. <eol> xxx did not flinch. <eob>
xxxx
Well, xxxx a # xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism. <eob>
And # when he xxx seven, <eob> xx had xxx xxx seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
# xxxx ground. <eol> He <eob>
Jini's are xxxxxx immigrants. <eob>
They came to # the xxxxxxx <eol> with # resources <eol> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it up # xx # xxxx to enroll family # <eob> in Medicaid. <eob>
was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission <eol> became her company, xxx that xxxxxxx bid on, won <eol> xxx delivered on that # contract. <eob>
Here's Jini # to tell # you xxxx <eob>
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eol> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today it provides for <eol> and millions of # others. <eob>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid. <eob>
Every # row of is a life whose story # deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us <eol> that compelling why <eol> can the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to have accomplished. <eob>
objectives are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> they are <eob> xxx they're a # kind of vaccine <eol> xxxxx <eol> thinking. <eob>
You # think a rockstar <eob> be an unlikely xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono # used xxxx <eob> to # xxxx # a global war <eol> xxxxxxx poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first is xxxx # relief <eob> for the # poorest countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is universal access <eol> to drugs. <eob>
Now, why these good objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back xx # our # checklist. <eob>
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate? <eob>
How <eob>
# xxxxxxx does passion <eol> xxxx xxx # to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a perfect # rhyme with the head, <eob> then # passion means <eol>
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eob> the <eol> chemistry # contained # inside # xxx <eol>
gives # us # for risk, <eob> for trust, where failing not a fireable <eob>
And when xxx have that sort <eol> # structure xxx environment <eol> and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eob>
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eob> and magic # is right # the corner. <eob>
xxxx is perfect. <eob>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows.
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # <eob> key results. <eob> That's xxx # we meet # our <eob>
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound.
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx <eob> # realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx <eob> and they're verifiable. <eol>
# xxx xxxx key # results. <eob>
In xxxxx introduced OKRs <eol> to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and Sergey. <eob>
xxxx they are, <eol> # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eob>
he really xxxx <eol> was, <eob> "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eol> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I <eob> took xxxx as a kind <eol> of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> # objectives and xxx key <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've xxxxxxxxx them <eol> for everyone to xxxx <eob>
these xxx xxxx <eol> for bonuses # or for promotions. <eob>
xxxxxxx # set # aside. <eol>
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eob> and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> xxxxx was to # build <eol> the next client platform <eob> the future of web applications -- <eol> in other xxxxx the browser. <eob>
# very thoughtful <eob> how # he chose his # key # results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
could xx clicks # or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going <eob> to decide <eol> Chrome a # great or not.
So he had this # one <eob> three-year-long # objective: <eob> build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And then every # year <eol> he xxxxx to <eob> the xxxx # key # results, <eob> of users, he upped the # <eob> ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eob> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He xxx less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar # to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat <eol>
In the xxxxx # year, <eob> he the ante once # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million. <eob>
xxxxxxxx # an <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> improved # the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eol>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx <eob>
xxx I like story, <eob> not so # xxx the # xxxxx ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx <eol> carefully choosing the objective <eob> and then xxxxxxxx to it <eol> year # after xxxx after <eob>
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eob>
Now, I think of # OKRs <eol> as vessels xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eol> and xxxx <eob> of our # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters xx # the why <eol> that we xxxx into those # vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be for a strong culture <eob> or # for stronger leadership, <eob> # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, <eol> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eob>
I # to <eob> think <eol> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment. <eob>
Do you # # right <eob>
xxxx xxxx xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do it xxxxxx <eol>
If you'd some feedback # them, <eol> you can send # to # me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If think xx world-changing goals of an Intel, of <eol> a # Nuna, xx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're # remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable xxxxxx <eol> high-quality for ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all xxx <eob> # information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eol> xx powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been xxxxxx <eol> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eob> xxx I want you <eol> to join # me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because we can # take xxxx <eol> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
We can take them <eob> to # families, to our schools, <eob> even to our governments. <eob>
those governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can back on the track <eob> if we can and # do measure <eob> what really xxxxxxxx
# you. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
What # history? <eob>
It is # something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eol> should be # focused on xxxxxxx <eob> like # Lenin # or <eob>
xx a result, people xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something xxxx was predetermined <eob> or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could not <eol> influence it in xxx way.
Many Russians today do xxx believe that Russia could been <eol> will a truly # democratic xxxxxxx <eob> # this is due # to the <eob> way <eob> history has been framed <eol> xxx # Russia. <eob>
And this is true. <eob>
To prove # it, # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx <eob> to xxx year <eob> the xxxx of the Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if internet <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx <eol> x social network xxx dead # people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eol>
My team and x created # our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded <eol> all possible # real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 xxxxxx <eob> 100 ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or can # follow a xxxx feed <eol> for each day <eob> 1917 <eob> xxx read what people <eol> xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, xxxxx xx # Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eol> being xxxxxx like you and me, <eob> xxx demigods, <eob> # we see that history # <eol> of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxxxxxx # was a for many Russians, <eob> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could # never have prevailed, <eob> just # because xxxxxxxxx <eol> was xxx our destiny. <eob>
xxx if we # take broader <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, # xxxx # led to <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But this project, we # xxx that Russia <eol> have # had a # different history <eob> and a xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the posts xxxx # <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> xxx the # first # country # in the <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or xxx of the <eol> xxxxx # ones <eol> to grant women # voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced # history can help a better <eob> because history is just a rehearsal what's happening xxxxx now. <eob>
We xx need new <eob> telling history, <eob> and xxxxx xxx example, <eob> we started # a new online # project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> xxx that # is # an online series that # you an impression <eol> of year, <eob> a # year by social change <eob> that, many ways, <eol> the # world as we xxxx it <eob>
But we # making <eob> that history xxxxx <eol> by xxxx if <eob> xxx the main <eol> could xxxxxx ... <eol> just like that?
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting for the values, <eob> no if they lived <eol> in US or in USSR <eob> or xx France or xx # China or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By xxxxxxxx history <eol> in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> through # media, <eob> we show that people <eob> in # <eol> are <eob> not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eol>
gives any user a possibility <eol> xx reclaiming <eol>
Ordinary people matter.
They have an
Ideas matter. <eob>

Computer algorithms today <eol> xxx performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> with accuracies, a xxxxxxx <eol> using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

AI # xx poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on xxx lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eob> we still face xxxxxxx challenges <eob> in detecting and <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eob>
of patients every xxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> due to xxxxx and # oral cancer.
best # way to # help these patients <eol> is to # perform early # detection <eol> and diagnoses of these # diseases. <eob>
So how do # we detect today, <eol> and can # artificial <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx help? <eol>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first <eob> expensive <eol> medical imaging # technologies <eob> xxxx <eol> as imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx expert physician then diagnoses <eol> # talks xx # the patient. <eob>
As you # xxx see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # # expert # physicians, <eol> expensive imaging technologies, xxx # is not <eol> # considered practical <eob> the developing xxxxxx <eob>
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized # nations, xx <eob>
So, can we solve # this # problem <eol> using artificial intelligence? <eob>
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence # architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> repeat, on an order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eob> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After xxxxx I would then # go <eol> an expert <eob> would # then analyze <eob> those images for # me. <eol>
And # using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> I <eob> can # a # standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning <eob> to # provide # xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> approaches <eob> suffer from the same # problem. <eob>
xxxxx # amounts xx xxxxx # <eol> expert # <eol> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these important <eol> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what xx group # at MIT Media <eob> xxxxx <eob>
We variety <eol> xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx solve xxxx xx the most important <eol> challenges facing <eob> us # <eob> in medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In the # example I shared <eol> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eol> we wanted xx # reduce <eol> of medical imaging technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
our first goal, <eob> xx starting <eol> xxxx # tens and thousands <eob> these very expensive medical images, <eob> xxxx <eob> traditional <eol> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and I <eol> figured out a very clever # <eol> way <eob> to extract # billions <eol> xx information packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eob> colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and rendering # of xxxxxxx <eol> on the # medical image. <eol>
In a # we # one image <eol> xxxx # billions xx training data points, <eob> massively reducing xx data <eol> needed for <eob>
xxx our goal, <eob> to # the # use <eob> of # expensive medical <eol> imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light <eob> acquired <eob> either # from a # camera <eol> or x mobile # phone, xxx the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions # of information # packets? <eob>
xx overlaid xxxxx from <eol> xxxxxxx image onto # this image, <eob> something <eol> that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much to xxx surprise, <eol> we <eob> xxxx required -- <eob> I only 50 -- <eob> these images # <eol> our algorithms # xxxx # efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using # <eol> very medical # images, <eob> we now train the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using 50 of these high-resolution, but standard # <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and # xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> and provide xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, # white light <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx from the <eob> instead # of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that # xx # <eol> to enter xx # era where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make <eol> impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think that thinking xxxxx traditional AI, <eob> which <eol> is data-rich xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eol> about # unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which <eob> can accept xxxxxxx of data <eol> and xxxxx some xx the most xxxxxxxxx <eol> problems facing # us today, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in <eol> health care. <eob>

So in # xxxx case, <eob> instead <eob> the immune cells rushing # <eol> towards to fight <eob> they're rushing toward an # injury. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx # <eol> xxxx of immune cell, <eob> helper T cell, was present # inside <eol> that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound <eol> healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and break your xxxxxx <eob> xxx try xxx tape it together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but it not be <eol> in xxxx # functional <eob> way, <eob> # we'll get a <eob>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, <eob> xxx muscle <eol> fat cells inside of it, <eob> and # if there's # fat in # our muscle, <eol> isn't as <eob>
Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eol> xxx body # grow back <eol> without # scars <eol> and <eol> look like # what it was <eol> before we were even # <eob>
I'm working to create <eol> that give xx # the signals <eol> to new tissue <eob> by # the immune response. <eol>
We know that # time <eol> a # material is xxxxxxxxx # body, <eob> the <eob> immune # xxxxxxx # xx # it. <eob>
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # xxxxx new <eob>
when I <eol> place material, <eol> scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system # creates <eol> small # environment of cells and proteins <eob> xxxx can change xxx # way <eol> that # our stem cells behave.
Now, just like the weather <eol> our xxxxx # activities, <eob> like going for a run <eob> or inside binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that <eob> our # stem cells # xxxx # and # develop. <eob>
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eob> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eob> we get xxx cells instead of muscle. <eob>
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eol> of a variety of different # <eob> plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, <eob> that are more or less porous, <eob> gels different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even xxxx materials <eob> release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So # in xxxxxx # orchestrate <eol> xxxxxxxx show cells <eob> xx # giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> # can # be changed # for different <eob> tissues, <eob> just # like a producer xxxxx change the set <eob> for # "Les # Mis" versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx combining specific # of signals <eob> that xxxxx our body to injury <eol> to help us # regenerate. <eol>
the xxxxxxx we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eob> a moldable filler <eol> even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't # to wake up xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx xx able to heal Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next # Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these # advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx # with our <eob> immune system <eol> to help and heal wounds, <eob> could xxxxx xxxxxx <eol> products # the market <eob> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eol> xx # help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe day be # able <eol> # keep pace xxxx a salamander. <eob>

So, as # a child, <eob> I used # to spend # of xx # time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, # humid, summer # days, <eol> I dash # the # floor <eob> and xxxxx my <eol> xxxx front # of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> a privileged # xxx xxx community. <eob>
Growing stories next-door xxxxxxxxx <eol> having xx set up fake energy accounts <eol> or xxxxxx <eob> seemed normal # <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get <eob> xx xxxxxxxxx would xxxx no choice but # to # the <eob> after their heat # was xxxx off, <eob> xxxx # keep their # family <eol> comfortable one # day. <eob>
These xx dangerous <eol> incidents # can take root <eob> when people are # xxxxx <eol> with choices. <eob>
In the US, xxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> percent of their # income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx and rural xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can spend # 20, even xx percent <eol> of their income on xxxxxxx <eob>
2015, xxxx caused over <eol> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> xx provide power to # their homes. <eob>
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden. <eob>
xxxxxx burdens are # so xxxx <eol> xxxx just x number. <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxx choices: <eob> Do you <eob> take your child <eol> to her # flu medicine, <eob> xx do # you feed her? <eob>
Or do you # keep her <eob>
xxxx an choice, and # month, <eob> seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy.
This a xxxx # larger <eol> and systemic xxxxxx <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people xx color, <eob> who spend xxxx xxx xxxx <eob> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eol> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass <eol> of 37 million xxxxxx # a xxxx <eob> who are xxxxxx to xxxxxx energy <eol> for # xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, <eob> those # with <eol> high energy # burdens <eob> have # a greater likelihood # of conditions <eol> like # heart disease and # asthma. <eob>
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have the tools to # xxxxxxx <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eol>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology <eob> are # decreasing. <eob>
even as we <eob> the majority of xxxxx who own <eol> # much more # than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when # I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
# is to alleviate <eol> energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, <eob> utilities and # xxxxxxxxxx alike <eob> provide <eol> to # energy, <eob> energy energy technology. <eob>
But # there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in # the xxxxx <eol> of # local <eob> in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect <eol> of relationships.
So xx by working directly <eol> the communities <eob> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx
We host <eol> and events <eob> # for communities to # xxxxxx poverty, <eob> and how making even <eol> updates to their homes <eob> like xxxxxx insulation windows <eol> and heaters <eob> # go # x long way # xx # maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting <eol> to community # solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart # home research <eob> and # installation xxxxxxxx <eob> to help families bring # down <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're xxxx working # directly <eol> with elected # <eob> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eob> of # energy and resilience <eob> we have to xxxx together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US # spends <eol> over # three billion a year <eob> energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eol> millions # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they're only able xx help <eol> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx <eob> there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure and impartial access <eob> to energy that clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At # scale, microgrid technology, <eol> xxx energy efficiency <eob> dramatically # improve xxxxxx health. <eob>
And for those xxxx # high burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent xx their income -- <eob> xx # percent of a person's income <eol> struggling to make xxxx # meet.
xxxx is life-changing.
This is xx <eol> for # use # their energy savings <eob> to sponsor their future. <eob>
I xxxxx # back to my great-grandmother and # her neighbors, <eob> xxx impossible choices <eol> xxxx # they xxxx <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on xxxxx <eob>
is # not just about <eob>
There are xxxxxxxx nationwide # having <eol> to make the # <eol> same xxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
And # high energy burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities technology, <eob> we have # the paths to overcome them. <eob>

Their # alignment enables their <eob> # their <eol> xxxxx # fast and <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, what does this have to xx <eol> with xxx one # us? <eol>
it's # one xxx # of illustrating # what <eol> I xxxxxxx to xx the # most xxxxxxxxx change <eol> that needed in ways of xxxxxxx <eob>
The world # is # getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we <eob> # need a # way of working, <eob> a way # xxxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxx # purpose, <eob> xxxx takes out xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that <eob> xxxxx empowers people <eob> to make faster. <eol>
But # the # question is: <eob> In # order # to # get there, <eob> are xx # willing to # xxxx up? <eob>
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eob> that wanted to # embark <eol> a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their offering to be # intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm xxx sure how many of you <eob> # a # bank from <eob> the inside, so let me try to illustrate <eol> # xxxx traditional banks like. <eob>
You see lots # of people # suits <eob> taking elevators xx go <eol> to department, <eob> sitting with marketers, <eol> xxxxxxxxx with engineers, # etc. <eob>
You see meetings # 20 # people <eob> nothing gets <eob>
Great xxxxxx They end up <eol> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eol>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
this # xxxx <eol> xxxx in to transform, would have xx # improve time to market <eob> by changing <eol> their ways xx working as well. <eob>
But xxxx <eob>
To # get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx <eol> to xxx have x look companies that seem # to xx more innovative, <eob> like Google, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And remember how we xxxx # <eol> the halls at xxx xx these # companies <eob> in # December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and a xxxx # xx bankers. <eob>
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eob> surrounded # by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we # asked, <eol> xxxx # is # your <eob> company organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx to # get org # chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny # names like # <eol> and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx explain how xxxx were organized. <eob>
So then tried to # <eol> that # our own world. <eob>
We # xxxxxx "How many # people <eol> are xxxxxxx for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who you xxxxxx to?" <eob> depends". <eob>
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" xxx depends". <eob>
You can our surprise. <eob>
xx were # xxxxxx for what we thought <eol> xx the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, over the # course # of that day, <eob> we gained <eol> understanding of # <eob>
They believed in xxx power <eol> of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups. <eob>
They xxx product people <eol> engineers in the same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and # <eob> test ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx <eob> independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eol>
xxxx # did not <eol> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They all the skills needed <eol> there in the team. <eob>
xxxx # at end of that day, <eol> xx had a <eob> to reflect xx what we # had learned. <eob>
And we started to # xxxx # their <eob> so # we already thinking xx how <eol> xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eob>
then, one # of the hosts, <eol> guy # who # had not # said a word # all # <eob> he suddenly xxxxx <eol> xxx x see you like xxx <eob> model.
But I # have one for # you: <eob> What # are you to give xxxx <eob> we willing # to give up? <eob>
xxx not # xxxx # an answer immediately, <eol> xxx we # knew # xx was right. <eob>
Change is only about <eol> xxxxxxxxx the xxxx <eob> it's about giving <eol> some of old as well. <eob>
Now, over # the # past years, <eob> I worked with companies <eol> all # xxxx # the world <eob> to change their xxxx xx # working. <eob>
And clearly, every company has xxx skeptics <eob> about why this is <eol> xxxxx xx for them. <eob>
"Our # is more complex," <eob> or # have <eol> the xxxxxx # xx # like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our # industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> xxxx x # have worked with <eob> change was possible. <eob>
a year, # we <eol> up old silos <eob> between # marketing, <eol> product, channels and xxx <eob>
Three # employees # were <eol> into 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams. <eob>
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just with # people <eob> engineers engineers, <eob> x product # person and an engineer <eol> xxxx now xxxxxxx of xxx xxxxx <eob>
You could be a xxxxxx of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for xxx mobile # banking app, xxxx <eol>
At the go-live date of xxxx new organization, <eob> people were xxxxxxx hands <eol> for # very # xxxxx # time, <eob> only to find xxx <eob> xxxx been <eol> xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from # each other <eob> but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # reports for last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, you're # the guy # that I <eol> xxxxxx chasing for answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee xxxxxxxx every <eob>
If the product guy <eob> has an idea, he can just # raise # it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eol> xxx # is # sitting right next # to him. <eob>
They xxxxxx test <eol> with customers immediately # -- <eob> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # no xxx tape, <eob> just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# getting there is not # easy. <eob>
And # it # turns out, <eob> are # you willing to give up?" <eob> is # exactly # right # to xxxx <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary <eob> # teams. <eob>
xxxxxxx # of going <eol> up xxx # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx want # xxx team to # decide. <eob>
xx do <eol> we need xxx the skills <eol> and for xxxx <eob> in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eol> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxx or even <eol> different xxxxxxxxx # today? <eob>
xx should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things <eob> across # xxxxxx <eol>
We still need some xxxx <eol> of management xxxxxxx <eob>
# these changes to structure <eol> and process procedure -- <eob> they xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eol> x found the most <eol> difficult thing to <eob> change <eob> is our own behavior.
Let xx try to illustrate. <eob>
If we # these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx <eol> commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, # how # xxx
No micromanagers. <eob>
But # it also # each employee <eol> needs to become leader, <eob> regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title.
It's # about all of # us up <eol> to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all # teams <eol> xxxxxxx in different <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> because # that would <eol> certainly lead # to chaos. <eob>
# we need and # autonomy <eol> at # same <eob> just xxxx a flock # of birds. <eob>
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, and # each new behavior, <eob> there xx <eob> on something as # well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure <eol> xxxx everyone # in xxx organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose the why <eob> and the -- what. <eol>
But # then xxxx xxxx let go <eol> # trust their # teams <eob> to the xxxxx decisions <eob> xx to get # there. <eob>
Now, <eol> creating alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eob>
But you know # how say <eol> that information is a source of xxxxxx <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information may feel as # if <eol> they're giving up xxxx power. <eob>
xxx it's # not just managers.
The teams need to communicate openly and transparently as well. <eob>
these # the # xxxxx <eol> typically work in short # sprints, and at the end # # sprint, <eol> they organize # a demo session <eob> xx share # the output <eol> of # what they've done, transparently. <eob>
xxxx each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working xx <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> be uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eol> xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do <eol> xx transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eob> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive # at # another company <eob> to explain he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eol> instead of looking at # <eol> status reports, <eob> he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # the team floors <eol> attend one of their sessions. <eob>
xxx instead of # telling people what xx <eob> looks # <eol> ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change <eob> for # someone # who used # xx be <eol> master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eob>
In xxxxxxxx many # projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
xxx I <eob> have # more # transparency, <eob> I can course-correct <eol> much # earlier if needed".
And managers need to # change as well. <eob>
First # of all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was <eol> this <eob> idea of thinkers and # <eob>
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx instead xx only <eol> managing other # people, <eol> middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches. <eol>
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been <eol> other people what to xxx <eob> but now xxxxxx expected <eol> to # # # again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and great people # leave the # company. <eob>
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
xxx of this is hard <eob>
xxx # it's worth it. <eob>
xxx companies that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx <eol> new # features # few times <eob>
xxx they have releases every few # <eob> # without # xxxxxxxxx <eol> the xxx tape, <eob> whole xxxxxxxxxxxx becomes more efficient. <eob>
And # if you walk the # halls <eol> xx these today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It # feels as if you're # xxxxxxx <eol> the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx <eob> they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to # respond to <eob>
xxxxx is getting faster <eol> and more # xxxxxxxx <eob> so we # need # to reboot # our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change <eol> is not # structure <eob> or process # <eob> and xxxx also not <eol> senior taking charge. <eob>
Leaders xx all of those <eol> in # the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
all have # to lead the # change. <eob>

We're xxxxxx up on # over 800 # employees, <eol> and # xxxx live everywhere, <eob> from to Mississippi, <eol> to where # I live in Texas. <eob>
xxxx in 67 # xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Canada, Mexico, xxx <eob>
# of them # choose not even <eol> to # x # home base, they're <eob>
xxxxxxx are <eol> xx # Airbnbs, <eob> they # are in new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
xx long as they can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> from the very # beginning. <eob>
Notice x don't xxx xxx word # "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eob> xxxx some are essential <eob> and some aren't. <eob>
use xxx word "distributed" <eol> xxxxxxxx # what we do, <eob> where everyone xx <eol> on # xxxxxxx field. <eob>
I think a # distributed workforce <eob> is # most effective xxx <eol> to # company. <eob>
The key is you have to <eol> # consciously. <eob>
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, <eob> many of # xxx first # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx <eob> people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years. <eob>
I # wanted to continue xxxx <eol> for one # reason. <eob>
I believe # that talent and are equally distributed the world. <eob> is # not. <eob>
In <eol> the tech xxxxxxxxx fish <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> the # same # small or xxxx <eob>
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx fish from # the entire ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # who # grew up <eol> in xxxxx # but lives in California, <eob> # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are xx # world. <eob> They bring a # <eol> understanding # of xxxx # culture <eob> and # a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of xxx decision <eob> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # how # xxxx do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a <eol> where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, <eob> you can make your <eob> # own schedule. <eob>
Everyone have <eol> a xxxxxx office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you # can choose there's music <eol> xxx when silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx <eol> the xxxx should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> spend commuting <eob> and put xx into things <eol> that important xx
A # distributed workforce <eol> is ideal a # company. <eob>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, <eob> "This works for y'all, <eol> xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # an # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx # do # few xxxxxx <eol> to # build distributed <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In xx it's easy <eol> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, <eob> in the kitchen, # in xxx <eob>
But if # people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eol> are having conversations <eob> they xxxxx xxxx access <eob> they'll these xxxxxxxxx being made <eol> without understanding the xxxx <eob>
Always leave x trail # of xxxxx you were <eol> and what xxx were thinking about. <eob>
This # allows others pick xx <eol> you # left off. <eob>
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eol> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> it's great to think as # an organization <eob> people and xxxxxx <eob>
have as much communication <eob> as <eol> possible xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows # people up <eob>
You xxxx xxxx to find xxx # <eob>
There xxx so xxxx apps and xxxxxxxx that help # with day-to-day communication, <eob> xxxxx conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The things # that changed how # you xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx aren't objects # anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So xxxxxxxxxx with xxxxxxxxx <eol> tools that enable # collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create <eol> productive, face-to-face # time. <eob>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place xx weeks out of the year <eob> and <eob> you # might <eol> three four # xxxxx apart. <eob>
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> a # year <eob> xx # do a grand # <eob> xxxxx xxx entire company <eob> comes for a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is people. <eob> xxxx to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on xxxx page, and xxxx xxxx # a deeper <eol> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # <eol> the rest xx the year, <eob> they can bring together <eol> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy.
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx their # own work environment. <eob>
Every person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> xxxx put <eol> towards a co-working # xxxxx <eob> or to buy so <eob> # they don't <eol> out of xxx coffee shop. <eol>
One # in Seattle xx pool their stipends together <eob> and rented <eol> a # on x xxxxxxx pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eol> gets x home-office stipend. <eob>
xxxx # is money can invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # right # chair, monitor, <eob> # right xxxx so # they can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eob>
Today, there are just a # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx <eob>
In a decade or # xxxx <eol> x predict that 90 percent <eob> of companies that are to be # changing <eol> the # course of xxx xxxxx <eob> are going function way. <eol>
They will to be distributed # first, <eol> or # they'll # be replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx xxxxx <eol> what you're # going xx xxxxx next, <eob> consider xxx # you can tap <eob> into # global talent, <eob> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work where they # feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully whatever <eol> it # is you're creating together. <eob>
