Imagine waking up a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you online, <eob> waking up to # an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome # to the world of cyberharassment. <eol>
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women face <eol> xx <eol> Pakistan <eol> is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes deadly <eol>
This xxxx of harassment keeps women from accessing xxx internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a form of oppression. <eol>
is xxx <eol> sixth most populous <eol> country the world, <eob> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access <eol> to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down <eol> with xxx rise new technologies.
Pakistan is # <eob> also the birthplace <eol> of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # <eob> xxxxx winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect is # where <eol> the twisted concept <eob> of honor <eob> is linked # to women and # their bodies; <eob> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> even kill them sometimes <eob> the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where <eob> xxxxx # are left # to <eob> die <eob> right outside their houses <eob> for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol>
Let me say this very clearly: it's # xxx honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a small village <eol> in # Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education.
The # elders of <eol> # my family <eol> allow women <eob> to pursue # their higher education <eol> or xxxxx careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father # was # one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns <eob> of <eob>
But in xxx end, I knew it's either me xx them, <eob> chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own x mobile <eol> until x was married.
And even I was married, <eob> this tool # became a tool <eol> for my xxx surveillance. <eol>
xxxx I resisted this idea <eob> of surveilled my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve # of this <eob> and threw me # out of # his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah.
And that was # the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
are women not # allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
While the law states x xxxxx <eol> has <eob> # the same equal <eob> to the # information, <eob> why is it always men -- # brothers, <eol> fathers <eob> and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?"
So <eol> to take # a step, <eob> instead of # keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 to the issues <eob> and # women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eob>
lobbying xxx free and safe internet <eob> xx convincing young women <eob> that <eob> to the safe xxxxxxxx <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my part <eob> in igniting # the spark <eob> to address # <eob> the questions that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With a xxxx in my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December xxxx -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to # the women <eob> who do xxx know who to turn to <eob> when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online. <eob>
I think of the women # who do not # have <eob> the necessary support to # deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go about daily xxxxxxxx that is x rape threat in their <eol> in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the <eob> is an to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eol>

(Applause) <eob>
at # critical moment.
Our leaders, <eob> of our <eob> great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # failing <eob>
Why? <eob>
In # some cases, # <eob> it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
And this # is unacceptable.
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
xxx are we # xxxxx to xxxxxx the right course?
It's not going to be easy.
For I've worked with talented teams and they've # chosen the right objectives and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of # them have <eol>
And <eob> today # # to share with xxx <eob> what # really makes x xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eol> how xxx why <eob> they set meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to # 1975. <eob>
Yep, this <eob> # # me. <eob>
I've got a xxx to learn, <eol> I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long # hair, <eob> but # I'm # working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the # greatest manager <eol> of his or any # other era. <eob>
Andy was # a superb <eol> and also a teacher, and he said # to me, "John, <eol> it almost <eol> # doesn't matter xxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy # a system <eol> called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # kind of rolls off <eol> xxx tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxx it's all about excellent
So a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of Andy xxxxxx
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eol> management by objective systems <eob> are the # objectives and the key results, <eol> and they <eob> match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx
xxx key results <eob> have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can # look <eol> and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I not that?" <eol> No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, or OKRs, are a # simple goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and they # work for organizations, they work teams, they even <eob> work for individuals. <eob>
are what <eob> want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how <eob> I'm going xx get that <eob> done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's <eol> the truth: <eob> xxxx of us are goals wrong, <eob> and most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eol>
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their numbers, <eol> but they lack a sense of <eob> purpose <eol> to xxxxxxx their teams. <eob>
So # xxx do you set these goals the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, must answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eol> combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to <eob> their # passion and to their # purpose, <eob> they develop a clear <eol> and compelling # sense of why. <eol>
x want to tell you # a story.
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs <eol> of lots of workers # at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the <eol> company's life, <eob> the government issued a proposal <eob> to build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eol>
Now, you'll # <eol> that Medicaid is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our # xxxxx our children and people with disabilities.
Nuna <eob> the time was # just 15 <eob> people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, and # they had a <eob> set of commitments <eol> xxxx they xxx to honor, <eob> and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money xx the project. <eob>
xxxx xxx <eol> a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did <eob> not flinch.
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And he was seven, <eob> he had his # xxxxx grand mal seizure at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eol>
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants.
They came # to the # country xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her <eob> family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine # years old. <eob>
That moment defined her <eob> mission, <eol> and that mission became her company, <eob> xxx that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on <eol> that <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxx Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved <eob> my family from bankruptcy, <eol> and # today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for <eol> millions others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of xxxx # a life <eob> whose story deserves with <eob> dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's <eol> story tells us that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> are inspiring, <eob> and they're kind of xxxxxxx against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think # a rockstar <eob> would be unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eol> but xxx years, <eol> Bono has OKRs <eob> to wage a global xxx <eol> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx <eol> and his ONE organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The # is xxxx relief <eob> for the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eob>
The next xxxxxxxxx access anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good <eob>
xxxxx xx back to # our checklist. <eob>
Check. # Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) <eob> Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does # your passion <eob> lead xxx to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a rhyme # with the # head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
# OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx <eob>
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for risk, for trust, where failing not a fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> xx structure and environment <eob> and the right people, magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and magic is right around the # corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, <eob> xxxx Bono the # whats # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn # attention the xxxxx <eob>
Remember, the hows the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry # and Sergey. <eol>
Here they <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
What he really # said was, <eob> "We any other to manage this company, so it a go". <eol> (Laughter)
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written down <eol> her objectives and her key <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've xxxxxxxxx # them <eol> for everyone to <eob>
And these are not <eob> used <eol> for bonuses or for <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx
They're # set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eol>
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> which was to <eol> build the xxxx generation client platform <eob> for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> in other words, build xxx browser.
He was very xxxxxxxxxx <eol> about how # he chose his key results. <eob>
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser? <eob>
It could be <eob> ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx <eob> xx not. <eob>
So he this # one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the <eol> best browser. <eob>
And then every year he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the ante. <eol>
In first year, his # was 20 million users <eol> and he missed it. <eob>
He less xxxx 10. <eob>
Second year, <eob> he raised <eol> the bar to 50 <eol> million.
He got to 37 million users.
xxxxxxxx better. <eob>
In the # third year, <eob> he upped the ante once xxxx <eol> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved xxx technology, and kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 # million users. <eol>
Here's why I like this # story, <eob> xxx so much for the happy <eob> but it someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's x perfect story for nerd me.
Now, I <eol> think of OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
really matters is # the xxx <eob> that xx pour xxxx those vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
are x silver # bullet. <eol>
They're <eob> not going to # <eol> a substitute a strong culture <eob> or for leadership, <eob> but # when those # <eol> fundamentals are # in place, <eol> they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eol>
I # want you # <eol> to # think <eob> about your life for a moment. <eol>
Do you # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write # down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eob>
xx it today. <eob>
If # like some feedback on them, <eol> you # can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think <eob> of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx <eob> affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for # everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access to xxx the <eob> world's information.
Here's <eob> the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered <eob> xxxxx by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called <eol> the <eol> xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading good gospel <eol> according # to Andy xxxxxx <eob> but I want you <eol> to join xx # in this # movement. <eob>
Let's fight what it is <eob> xxxx really # matters, <eob> because we can # take OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
# can take them to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to <eol> # our governments. <eob>
We can xxxx those # governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track if we can and do measure <eob> what really matters. <eob>
Thank <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What is history? <eob>
It is something written <eob> by the winners. <eob>
is a stereotype that history <eob> should be focused on the rulers, <eol> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people in countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at as something <eol> that was <eob> or determined xx leaders, and common people could xxx influence it <eob> in any way.
Many Russians today do not believe that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eob> or ever will xx <eol> a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to the <eob> way <eol> history has xxxx framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two # <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year xx the Russian Revolution. <eob>
x <eob> asked myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eol>
So last year, we built <eol> a # social <eob> network xxx dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than <eob> 3,000 people <eob> 100 # years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website # xx application <eob> follow a feed <eol> xxx each day of 1917 and read what people <eol> like # xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others <eol> thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like <eob> # you xxx me, <eol> not # demigods, <eob> and <eob> we see that history consists <eol> of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eol>
xxx project was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx <eol> who used to think that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas <eob> of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eob> xxx xxx our <eob> destiny. <eob>
But we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
1917 # led to 70 years <eol> of communist <eol> dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx this # project, we see # that Russia <eol> could <eol> # have had a different history <eob> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as # any other country could or still can.
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eob> you learn that xxxxxx <eol> was first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing # history and understanding <eol> xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eob> can help # us create a future, <eob> because history is xxxx a rehearsal <eol> of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eob>
We do need new <eob> ways of telling history, <eob> and <eob> this xxxxx for example, <eob> we started a <eob> # <eob> xxx online project that called 1968Digital.com, and that is an online documentary <eob> that gives you <eob> an impression <eol> of that xxxxx <eob> a year marked by global social change that, many ways, <eol> xxxxxxx the world as know it <eob> now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all # the main <eob> could use mobile phones # ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that x lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and were fighting the same <eob> values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or France or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic <eob> way, <eob> through # <eol> social media, <eob> we show that people xx power <eol> are not the <eol> only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives # any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eob>
We shape
We all make history. <eob>
you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at <eob> a massive scale, <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eob>
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eol> is often <eob> referred to xx AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eob> on our lives in the # future. <eol>
Today, # however, <eol> we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several # life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases xxx cancer.
xxxxxxxxx of every lose their # lives <eol> due to <eob> liver and # oral cancer.
Our xxxx way xx help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases. <eob>
So how xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert physician xxxxx # orders <eol> very expensive <eol> medical xxxxxxx technologies <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are # collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those images and talks to <eob> the patient. <eob>
As you can see, this is <eol> a very process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is considered practical <eol> for the # <eob> developing world. <eob>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can # we this <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eob> these very expensive medical # <eol> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then # <eol> # an # expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze those images for <eob>
And # using those two pieces xx information, <eob> I can train a <eol> standard <eob> deep neural network <eol> xx deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's # diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, <eob> traditional # <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> xxx # expert medical imaging technologies.
So, can we invent <eol> more scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very <eol> problems facing today? <eob>
And this is exactly what my group at MIT Media xxx does. <eob>
We have <eob> invented # a variety <eol> of unorthodox # AI architectures <eob> to solve some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical # trials.
In # the example I shared <eob> with you today, we had two goals. <eol>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> xxx number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients.
So how <eob> we # do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and <eob> thousands <eob> of these very # expensive images, <eob> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started <eol> a single medical image. <eob>
From this # image, my team and x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions of information # packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering xx the disease <eob> xx the medical image. <eob>
In x sense, we converted # one <eol> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the # amount of <eob> data <eol> needed xxx training. <eol>
For our second xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the use expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we <eob> started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information # packets? <eol>
We overlaid those from <eol> xxx medical image onto this <eob> creating something <eol> that we call a composite <eol> image. <eob>
Much to our we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, # xxxx # 50 # -- <eol> of composite images to train <eol> xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies.
To summarize <eob> xxx approach, <eob> instead of using <eol> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the AI <eol> in an # unorthodox way, <eol> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> xxx xxxxxx phones, <eol> and provide diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can # accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, some # very simple, # white <eob> light <eol> photographs from patient, <eob> of # expensive <eol> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I believe that we are # poised <eol> to enter an # where artificial # intelligence <eob> is to make an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> impact # on our xxxxxxx <eob>
I think that xxxxxxxx about traditional AI, <eob> which data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue # thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept # small xxxxxxx # of data <eol> and solve some of the most important <eob> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx especially in xxxxxx # care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, like getting # over <eol> a cold, <eob> you could your wounds faster? <eol>
Today, xx we have <eol> an operation or # xx accident, <eob> we're in the <eob> hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx give <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eol>
like vaccines instruct <eol> our body <eol> to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct our immune system <eob> to build tissues <eol> and quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing <eob> body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several # organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eob> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and # even us mere <eob> can # regrow our liver <eob> after losing more <eob> than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make xxxx magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can wounds # and build # tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the immune system.
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eob> xxx immune system defends <eol> our # body from danger. <eol>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to key players in our fight to build back <eol> xxx cuts and bruises. <eob>
xxxx looking at materials <eol> that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities <eob> to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed <eol> that after treating <eol> an injured xxxx these materials, <eob> xxxxx was a large number of <eob> immune xxxxx in xxxx material <eob> and the <eol> surrounding muscle. <eol>
xx in this case, <eob> instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off towards infection fight bacteria, they're rushing toward # an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of xxxxxx cell, <eol> the helper T cell, <eob> was present <eob> inside <eol> material that I implanted <eol> xxx absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were x kid and # you'd break your pencil try # and tape it back together again, can # heal, <eob> but # it might not be <eol> # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll xxx a scar. <eob>
So if # we xxxxx have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of <eob> healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx as # strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eol> without these scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eob> xx changing the immune
We know that any time <eob> a material # implanted in our # body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eob>
This ranges xxxx pacemakers <eol> to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials # that engineers <eob> are using <eol> xx try and new <eob>
xx when # I xxxxx that material, <eol> or # scaffold, <eol> in body, <eob> the immune creates <eol> small environment cells and proteins <eob> that change the xxx that our stem cells behave. <eob>
just like <eob> the # weather <eol> affects our # daily activities, <eob> like # going for a run <eob> or staying and entire TV show # Netflix, <eob> immune of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eob> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the signals, <eob> we <eob> get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds # are <eol> of a different things, <eob> plastics to naturally xxxxxxx materials, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx sponges that are or less porous, <eob> gels of stiffnesses.
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals time. <eob>
xx other # words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eol> by giving them the correct stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed # different <eol> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of signals <eob> that mimic # how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate.
In # the future, # we see a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing <eol> vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going to xxxx up tomorrow <eol> and be able xx heal # like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, <eob> and # working with our immune system <eob> to build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able <eol> xx keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

as a child, <eol> I used spend all of <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, days, <eol> x would dash xxxxxx # floor <eob> xxx stick my face in # front of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though # was a <eob> privileged one in # our community. <eol>
Growing up, stories of <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eol> or having to steal energy xxxxxx normal to me. <eob>
During # the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> xx bypass the meter <eob> after their heat <eol> shut off, <eol> xxxx to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day. <eob>
xxxxx of dangerous <eol> incidents xxx take root <eob> when people # are faced <eob> with impossible choices. <eol>
In the xxx the average American <eol> spends <eol> three percent of their income on # energy. <eob>
In # contrast, # low-income <eol> and xxxxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # spend 20, 30 percent <eob> of their income on energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over <eob> 25 million people to skip meals <eol> to <eob> provide # power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eol>
But energy burdens are xx much <eob> more <eob> than just a number. <eol>
present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # you take child <eol> get her flu medicine, or do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and nearly every month, <eol> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a <eob> much larger <eol> and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high # energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx
But nurses, <eol> and even <eol> schoolteachers <eob> who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx million people a year <eol> who are <eob> unable to <eob> afford energy <eol> for their most needs. <eob>
As a result, those xxxx <eol> xxxx energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma.
Look -- # given rockets to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized # <eob> we have the xxxxx to address <eob> these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is <eob>
Cost xx renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
even as we approach cost xxxxxxx <eob> the majority of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn <eob> much more than the average American. <eob>
This is why, # when I was 22, <eol> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eol>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by # with # communities, <eol> utilities and # government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe the power <eol> of local # communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So <eol> start by working directly with the communities <eob> xxxx have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops and events for communities <eob> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, and making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eob> like <eol> better insulation windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting # <eol> xx community solar <eob> and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation # programs <eob> to help families their # bills. <eob>
We're even working # xxxxxxxx <eol> with xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to <eob> see this vision <eol> of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eob> we xxxx to # work together sustainably. <eol>
Now, xxx # US spends over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these <eol> programs do help <eob> millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only able to help <eob> fraction of # those in need. <eob>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not
But by building energy equity <eol> and # resilience into our communities, <eob> we <eol> can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to that is clean, <eob> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At scale, # microgrid technology, <eob> clean technology and efficiency <eol> dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eob>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 # their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a # person's income <eol> who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eob>
This is # life-changing. <eob>
This is an opportunity <eob> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eob> to xxxxxxx their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eob> and xxx neighbors, <eol> the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # to make <eol> and xxx # effect # <eol> our whole xxxxxxxxxx
But this # is not just about # them. <eob>
There <eob> # are xxxxxxxx nationwide having <eol> to make the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eob> but # through relationships with communities and <eob> we have <eob> the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will # all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

Have ever a flock of birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in <eob> perfect synchrony: Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds would not be able to do that <eob> if they # all would have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed <eol> would simply be <eob> too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned on x few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eol> to make autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
alignment enables their autonomy, <eol> and <eob> their autonomy <eol> xxxxx them <eob> xxxx and flexible. <eol>
xxxx what does <eob> this have to do <eob> with any one of # us? <eob>
Well, it's one # of <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of working # today.
The world getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx <eob> a way that <eol> creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: In order to get there, what are we willing to give xxx
few years ago, # I was working with a <eol> wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They # wanted # xxxxx offering to be simpler, <eol> intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many <eob> you <eob> have seen a bank from the # inside, <eob> so # let me try to illustrate <eol> xxxx many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to go <eol> to their # department, <eol> marketers # sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc.
You see meetings with xx people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They <eob> end up <eob> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
anything # done xxx take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to # transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eol> # to market <eob> by drastically xxxxxxxx <eol> their ways xx as well.
xxx how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to # go and have a look at # companies <eob> # seem to <eob> be more innovative, <eob> xxxx <eol> Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember # how we xxxx walking <eol> the xxxxx at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> x management consultant <eol> and <eob> a xxxx of # bankers. <eob>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags and <eob> hoodies <eob> and lots # of # xxxxxx <eob> creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" we expected xx # get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> funny names like # "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" # explain they were organized. <eob>
So then we <eol> tried to xxxxxxxxx <eol> that to our # <eob> own world. <eob>
We <eol> asked, "How people <eol> are working for you?" <eol> "It <eob> depends".
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides your priorities?" "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eol>
We were # asking # for what we thought <eol> were some # of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and their answer xxxx "It depends". <eol>
Now, over the course of that xxxx <eol> xx gained a better xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their model. <eol>
They believed in # power of small, teams. <eol>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.
xxxx had product people <eol> and # <eob> IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, # build and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of # others in the # company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eol> xxxxxxx
xxxx had all the skills needed <eol> right there # in the team. <eob>
Now, at # the end of that day, <eob> we had a session to reflect xx what we had learned.
And xx had started to <eob> like their model, <eob> xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # bank. <eol>
But xxxxx # one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see like our # model. <eol>
But # I have one question for you: <eob> What # are willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have xx answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eob>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> on some # of the old as # <eob>
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I # have # worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their xxxx # of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own <eol> skeptics <eob> about <eob> why this not <eol> going work # xxx them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," xx "They # have <eol> the # <eob> legacy IT like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators # <eob> just won't this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eol>
Within a year, we # completely <eol> blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> xxxxxxxx channels and IT. <eob>
Three # employees xxxx # <eol> into # 350 teams. <eob>
So instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with product # people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a # product # person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the <eol> same <eob>
You could be a member of a team responsible for account opening <eob> or the <eol> mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> that # new organization, <eob> some people xxxxxxx hands <eob> for the very first time, <eob> to <eol> # find out that they # had been <eol> sitting two # away from each other <eob> but they xxxx <eob> sending each # other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 # years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy # that # I <eob> was always chasing xxx answers". <eob>
But they're <eol> every day. <eob>
xx the product guy xxx an idea, <eol> xx can just raise <eol> to get input the engineer <eol> xxx sitting right next # to # him. <eob>
They can to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eol> no handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red xxxxx xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eol>
Now, getting there is # not # easy.
xxx # as it turns out, <eob> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the # right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eol>
of decisions <eol> up and down the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide. <eol>
But to xx so, we need all the # <eob> and expertise for that # decision in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or <eol> different countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency in the way # we do things <eob> across these <eob>
We still <eob> some kind of management <eob>
Now, all these changes structure <eol> process and <eob> procedure -- <eol> xxxx # <eol> are not <eob>
in the end, I found that the # most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> xx our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me # try to illustrate. <eob>
we # want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like <eob> a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when # to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that each <eol> xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now # obviously, we also # cannot afford <eob> to have # <eob> all teams <eol> running <eob> in different directions, <eol> xxxxxxx that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eol> just a flock of <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, <eol> and with each new behavior, there # is giving up <eob> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure <eol> xxxx # everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around the overall -- # the why -- <eol> overall priorities -- <eob> the what.
then they have to let # go <eol> and trust <eol> # their <eol> # teams <eol> to make the right decisions <eob> on how to get # there. <eol>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you how they say <eol> that information # is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may # feel as they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
it's not just managers. <eob>
xxx teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently <eob> well.
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx teams <eol> typically work # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # end of every sprint, <eob> they organize a demo session <eob> share the output <eol> what they've transparently. <eol>
And every <eob> each # member of the gives # an update <eob> of what they are # working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can xx uncomfortable people, <eob> because there xx <eob> no place to # hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone.
So, # <eob> is not easy, <eol> providing autonomy <eol> not xx obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain <eob> xxx he used <eob> to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, # today, to know how things # are # going, <eob> instead of looking at reports, <eob> he needs to walk down the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, he looks for ways to help them. <eol>
That is <eob> xxxxxxx change <eob> for someone who used to xx <eol> a master of <eob>
But in the xxx world, this executive # said, <eob> "I only had the <eob> illusion xx control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would over time and xxxx budget, <eol> anyway. <eob>
Now I have xxxx more <eob> and # I can course-correct <eob> much if needed". <eob>
And middle <eol> need to <eol> change as well. <eob>
First xx all, without the handovers <eol> and # the PowerPoint, there's less of a xxxx <eob> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the world, there was <eol> idea of thinkers # and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of # only <eol> xxxxx people, <eob> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the 10 <eob> you have # just been telling <eol> xxxxxx what to do, <eob> but now # you're expected <eol> to <eob> do <eol> things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great leave the xxxxxxxx <eob>
But the result is # a new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And xxx this is hard work.
But <eob> it's worth
The that I worked # with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product a few times per year. <eob>
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole # organization becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if walk the halls <eol> xx these companies today, <eob> you just a # energy. <eob>
It feels <eob> as if you're walking <eol> the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet.
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx <eob> so we need reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest of that <eol> is not in structure <eob> or xxxxxxx or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eol> senior # executives xxxxxx <eob> charge. <eol>
Leaders will be all of <eol> in the organization <eol> who embrace the change.
xx all # have xx lead change. <eob>
So <eol> the question is: What are willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

The went viral, <eol> xxx at xxxxx it was pure xxxx <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about how happy it made them, <eol> how encouraged them to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to <eob> tell <eob> that little in my # head to just xxxx up <eob> let <eob> # myself be me. <eol>

Some of them not even <eol> to <eol> have <eol> a home base, they're xxxxxxx <eob>
they are in RVs <eol> or <eob> traveling xxxxxxx Airbnbs, <eob> xxxx are xx new places <eob> every day, week or month. <eol>
As xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't care where <eol> they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> from the <eol> very beginning.
Notice I don't the word "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
x use <eob> the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, where everyone is <eob> on # an playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed # workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> xx build a # company. <eob>
The xxx is you have to <eol> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eol> many the # first 20 hires <eol> were xxxxxx I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the tech # companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the same small pond or # bay. <eob>
x distributed xxxxxxx <eol> can fish from xxx entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring someone # grew up <eob> in Japan but <eob> lives in you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and # goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eol> xxxx bring a different <eol> understanding of culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At <eol> the base of <eol> to go distributed, <eob> xxxxxxx a desire to <eol> give <eol> people autonomy <eol> over xxx they # do their work. <eob>
Unless <eol> you're in a role <eol> where hours are important, <eol> you # can # your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have corner office, <eob> their windows, the # food they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music <eol> and when <eob> there's silence. <eol>
You xxx what temperature the room <eob> should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting and put it into things <eol> that are <eob> important to you. <eob>
A distributed # workforce <eol> xx xxxxx for x technology company.
But people often me, works great for xxxxxx <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you # have an office, <eol> you do a things <eol> to build <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx capability. <eol>
First: xxxxxxxx <eob> everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in <eol> # moment, <eob> in # the kitchen, # the <eob>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team are having conversations don't have <eol> xxxxxxx see these decisions made <eol> without understanding the why.
Always leave a trail where you were <eol> and what # you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to # pick up <eol> where you left off. <eol>
It allows in # <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eol> people and xxxxxx <eob>
Try to have # much # communication <eob> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's <eol> shared and public, <eol> xx # allows <eob> # new people to catch up <eob>
You also need to find the tools. <eol>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how you <eol> probably # aren't objects anymore. <eob>
xxxxxx you access <eol> through <eob> your computer. <eob>
So experiment xxxx different <eob> tools that enable <eob> see what xxxxxx <eol>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place <eol> weeks out of xxx year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks <eob>
We xxx to that: we come # together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eol> comes together a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eob> We # want to make # sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on same page, <eob> and they have a deeper <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they xxxx together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring xxxxxxxx <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And # the final practice: <eob> give people the <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend xxxx they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy <eob> coffee, so don't get kicked out # of the coffee shop. <eol>
One group in Seattle decided pool their stipends together and # rented a workspace on a pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is # money they can invest <eol> xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so can have <eol> the most productive environment for them.
Today, there are just a few companies that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict # that # 90 # percent of <eol> companies <eob> that are going to be <eol> the course of the # world <eob> are going to function this <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you think <eob> xxxxx <eol> xxxx you're going to build next, <eob> consider how you <eob> can tap into global xxxxxxx <eob> give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eol> xxxxx # they feel they xxxxxx <eob> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eol>
