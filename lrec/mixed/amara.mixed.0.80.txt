Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eol> sometimes multiple strangers -- questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up <eob> to an angry message, <eol> scared and worried for <eob> your safety.
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of harassment that women <eob> face in Pakistan is very serious <eob> and <eob> leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eob> from accessing the internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan is the sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eol> with 140 million people having access <eol> to mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 percent <eol> internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the rise of new technologies.
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eol>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eol>
Another aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women <eol> and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even <eob> kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called <eob> "family honor"; <eob> where women are left to die <eol> right outside their <eob> houses <eob> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in the name of "family honor".
Let me say <eob> this very <eob> clearly: <eol> it's not <eob> honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eol>
I come from a very small village <eob> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eob> to pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eob> didn't <eob> allow their women <eob> to pursue their higher education <eob> or their professional careers.
However, unlike the other <eob> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father <eob> was one who <eol> really <eob> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and <eob> [there <eob> were] frowns of disapproval. <eol>
But in the end, I knew <eol> it's either me or them, <eol> and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My family's traditions <eob> and expectations for a woman wouldn't allow me to own a mobile phone until I was married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eol> this tool became a tool <eol> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve of this <eob> and threw me out of his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eob>
And <eob> that was the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why?
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our Constitution? <eob>
While the law states that a woman has the same equal access <eol> to <eob> the information, <eob> why is it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided <eob> to take a step, instead of keep questioning <eob> these patriarchal structures and societal norms.
And I <eob> founded <eob> the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying <eob> for <eol> free and safe internet <eol> to convincing <eob> young women <eob> that access to the safe internet is <eob> their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to play my <eob> part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the questions <eob> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a hope in my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, I started Pakistan's and the <eob> region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause)
to extend my <eol> support to the women who do not know who to turn <eob> to <eol> when they face serious threats online. <eob>
I think of the women who do not have <eob> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their <eob> daily activities, <eol> thinking that <eol> there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box.
Safe access to the internet <eob> is an access to knowledge, <eol> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, I'm fighting <eol> for equality.
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
We're <eob> at a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
Why?
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eol> or <eol> unethical, but often, they've taken us <eob> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has to stop. <eob>
How <eol> are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going to choose the right course? <eol>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For <eob> years, I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen the right objectives and the wrong <eol> objectives. <eol>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to share with you <eob> what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, how and why <eol> they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons. <eol>
Let's go <eob> back to 1975.
Yep, this is <eob> me. <eol>
I've <eob> got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, <eol> but I'm working <eob> under Andy <eob> Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest <eob> manager <eol> of his or any <eob> other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader and also a <eob> teacher, <eob> and he <eol> said to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you know. <eob>
Execution is what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives <eob> and Key Results". <eob>
It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
And it's all about excellent execution.
So <eol> here's a classic video <eol> from the 1970s of <eob> professor Andy Grove. <eob>
(Video) <eob> Andy Grove: The two key phrases of the management by objective systems <eob> are the objectives and the key results, <eob> and <eob> they match the two purposes.
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to <eob> be <eob> measured, <eob> but at the end you can look <eol> and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I do that, or did I not do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and <eol> they work for organizations, they work for teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eol>
The objectives are <eob> what <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how I'm going <eol> to get that done.
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What <eol> and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eol> and most of us <eob> are <eob> not <eob> setting <eol> goals at all. <eob>
A lot of <eob> organizations set objectives and meet <eob> them.
They ship their sales, <eob> they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, <eob> but they lack a <eol> sense of purpose to inspire their teams. <eol>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the right way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eob> the question, "Why?" Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions <eol> to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eol>
I <eob> work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eol>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eol>
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they used data to serve the health needs <eol> of lots of workers at large companies. <eol>
And then two <eob> years <eol> into the company's life, <eob> the federal government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever cloud <eob> database for Medicaid. <eol>
Now, you'll remember <eob> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children <eol> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> that they had to honor, <eob> and <eol> frankly, they weren't going <eol> to <eol> make <eol> very much money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it.
She <eob> jumped at the opportunity. <eob> She did not flinch. <eol>
Why? <eol>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when <eob> he was seven, <eol> he had his <eob> first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eol>
They came to the <eol> country with <eol> limited resources speaking little English, so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine <eob> years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> and that company <eob> bid on, won <eol> and delivered on that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from bankruptcy, <eob> and today it provides for Kimong's health and <eol> for millions of <eob> others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is a life whose story deserves <eob> to <eob> be told with dignity. <eol>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eob> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are significant, <eob> they're <eob> action-oriented, they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar would be an unlikely user <eob> of <eob> Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eob> against poverty and <eob> disease, and his ONE organization <eob> has focused on two really gorgeous, <eol> audacious objectives. <eob>
The <eol> first is debt relief <eol> for the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are <eob> these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go <eob> back to our checklist. <eol>
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: <eob> So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eol>
What actions does your passion lead you to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means <eol> nothing. <eob>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it. <eol>
It gives us an environment for risk, for <eob> trust, <eob> where failing is not a fireable <eol> offense. <eol>
And when you have that sort <eol> of structure and <eol> environment <eol> and the right people, <eob> magic is around the <eob> corner.
JD: I love that.
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This <eol> is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eol> with Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eol>
Remember, the hows are the key results. <eol> That's how we meet our objectives.
And good results <eob> are specific and time-bound.
They're aggressive but realistic. <eol>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eol>
Those are good key results. <eol>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's <eob> cofounders, <eol> Larry and Sergey.
Here they are, <eol> 24 years <eob> old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eol>
Well, not quite. <eob>
What he really said was, <eob> "We don't have <eob> any <eob> other way <eob> to manage this <eob> company, so we'll give it a go". <eol> (Laughter)
And I took that as a kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every <eob> quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> her objectives and her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eol> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're <eob> used <eol> for a higher purpose, <eol> and that's to get collective commitment to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In <eob> 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eol> which was to build <eol> the next generation client <eol> platform for the future of web applications -- <eol> in other words, build the best browser. <eob>
He was very thoughtful <eol> about how he chose his key results. <eol>
How do you measure the best browser?
It could be ad clicks or engagement.
No. <eob> He said: numbers of <eob> users, <eob> because users are going to decide <eob> if Chrome <eob> is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had this one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eol> build the best <eob> browser.
And then every year he stuck to the same key results, <eol> numbers of users, <eob> but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, his goal was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eob> the bar to 50 million. <eol>
He got to 37 million users.
Somewhat better. <eol>
In the third year, <eob> he upped the ante once more <eob> to a hundred million.
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, <eob> but it shows <eob> someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking <eob> to it <eol> year <eol> after year after year. <eob>
It's <eol> a perfect story for a nerd like me. <eol>
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels <eol> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really <eob> matters is the why <eob> that we pour into those vessels. <eol>
That's why we <eol> do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be a substitute <eob> for a strong culture <eol> or for stronger leadership, but when those fundamentals are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take <eol> time to write down <eol> your values, <eol> your objectives and your key <eol> results. <eol>
Do <eol> it today. <eol>
If you'd like some feedback <eol> on them, you can send them to me.
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eol> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eol> access to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: every one of those goals <eob> is powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called <eob> the Johnny <eol> Appleseed of OKRs <eol> for spreading the good gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want <eob> you <eol> to <eol> join me in this <eob> movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that really matters, <eol> because we can take OKRs beyond our <eob> businesses. <eob>
We can take them to <eob> our families, to our schools, <eob> even to <eol> our governments. <eol>
We can hold those governments accountable.
We can transform those informations. <eol>
We can get back on the right track <eol> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters.
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
What is history?
It is something <eob> written by the winners. <eol>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eol>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or <eob> determined by <eob> the <eol> leaders, and common people could not <eob> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever will be a truly democratic nation, and this is due to the way <eol> history <eol> has been framed to the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And this is not true.
To prove it, I spent two years <eob> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eol> the year of the Russian Revolution.
I asked myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
So last year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eol> named Project1917.com. <eol>
My team and I created our software, <eol> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters written <eob> by more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago.
So any user of our website or application <eob> can follow a news feed <eob> for each day of 1917 and read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eol> Lenin or Pavlova and others <eol> thought and <eol> felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities being <eol> ordinary people like you and me, <eol> not demigods, <eob> and we see that <eob> history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only <eol> their "genius ideas". <eol>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eol> who used <eob> to think <eob> that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eol> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eol> was not our destiny.
But if we <eol> take a broader look, <eob> it's not <eob> that black and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we see <eol> that Russia <eob> could have had a different history and a democratic future, <eol> as any <eob> other country could or still can. <eol>
Reading the posts from 1917, you learn that Russia was the first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one <eob> of the first ones to grant women voting rights.
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can help us create a better future, <eob> because history is just a <eol> rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right <eol> now. <eol>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, we started a new <eol> online project that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and <eob> that is an online documentary series that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by global social change <eob> that, in many <eob> ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now.
But we are making that history alive <eob> by imagining what if all the main characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like <eol> that? <eol>
And <eob> we see that a lot of individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same values, <eob> no matter if <eol> they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in China or in Czechoslovakia.
By exposing history <eob> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social <eol> media, <eol> we show that people <eob> in power <eol> are <eob> not the only ones making choices. <eol>
That gives any user a possibility of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas <eol> matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eol>
We all make history.
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, using human-like intelligence. <eob>
And this intelligence of <eob> computers <eol> is often referred to as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence.
AI is poised to make an incredible impact on our lives in the future.
Today, however, we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such <eob> as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of patients every year lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our best way to help these patients <eol> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of <eob> these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> an expert physician first orders very expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eol> such <eob> as fluorescent imaging, <eob> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the <eob> patient. <eob>
As you can see, this is a very resource-intensive process, requiring both expert physicians, <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is not considered practical for the developing world. <eob>
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eol>
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using artificial intelligence?
Today, <eob> if I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eol> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical images <eob> first to <eob> be generated. <eol>
After that, I would then go to <eol> an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eob> those images <eob> for me. <eob>
And using those <eob> two pieces of information, <eol> I can train a standard deep neural network <eob> or a deep learning <eob> network <eol> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eol>
Similar to the first approach, <eol> traditional artificial <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from <eob> the same problem. <eob>
Large amounts of data, <eob> expert physicians <eol> and expert medical <eob> imaging technologies. <eol>
So, <eol> can we invent more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial <eob> intelligence architectures <eol> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing <eob> us today?
And this is exactly what my group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures to solve some of the most important challenges facing us today <eol> in medical imaging and clinical trials.
In the example <eol> I shared with you today, we had two goals.
Our first goal was to reduce <eob> the number of <eol> images required to train artificial intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eol>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, instead of starting with tens and thousands <eob> of these very <eol> expensive medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image.
From this image, my team and I <eol> figured <eol> out a very clever <eob> way to extract billions of information <eol> packets. <eob>
These information packets included colors, pixels, geometry and rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image.
In <eob> a sense, we converted one image into billions of training data points, massively reducing the amount of data <eob> needed for training. <eol>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to <eob> screen patients, we started with a standard, white light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> or a mobile <eob> phone, for the patient. <eol>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information packets? <eol>
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, <eol> creating something that we call a composite image.
Much to our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- <eob> of these composite images to train <eob> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eol>
To summarize our approach, instead of using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eol> we can now train the AI algorithms in <eob> an unorthodox way, using only 50 <eob> of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard <eob> photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms <eol> can accept, in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, white light <eol> photographs <eol> from the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that we are poised <eob> to enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence is <eob> going to make <eob> an incredible impact on our future. <eob>
And I <eob> think that thinking about traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we should also continue thinking <eob> about unorthodox <eol> artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the <eol> most important <eol> problems facing us today, especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eol>
(Applause)
What if you could take a pill <eob> or a vaccine <eol> and, just like getting over a cold, <eob> you could heal your wounds faster?
Today, if we have an operation or an accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eol> and often left with scars and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to create materials that instruct our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues.
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eol> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eol> to build tissues and more <eob> quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might <eol> seem <eob> like <eol> magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than half <eob> of <eol> its original mass.
To make this magic <eob> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating <eob> how our body can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through <eob> instructions <eob> from the immune system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eob> to that annoying sinus infection, <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eol> I was able to identify key players in <eob> our fight to build back <eob> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials that are currently being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured muscle with these materials, <eol> there <eol> was a large number of immune cells <eol> in that material and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
So <eol> in this case, <eob> instead of the immune cells rushing off <eol> towards infection to fight <eob> bacteria, <eol> they're rushing toward an injury. <eol>
I discovered a specific type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T cell, <eob> was present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eol> and absolutely critical <eob> for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and you'd <eol> break your pencil <eol> and try and <eob> tape it back together <eob> again, <eob> we can heal, <eol> but it might not be <eol> in the most functional way, <eob> and <eob> we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have these helper T cells, <eob> instead <eob> of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops fat cells <eob> inside of <eob> it, <eob> and <eob> if there's fat in our muscle, <eob> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, our <eob> body could grow back <eol> without these scars <eob> and look like what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials <eol> that give us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eol> by changing the immune response. <eol>
We know <eol> that any time <eob> a <eob> material is implanted <eob> in our body, <eob> the immune system will respond to it. <eol>
This ranges from pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to <eob> the materials that engineers are using <eob> to try <eol> and build new tissue.
So when I place that material, <eob> or scaffold, in the body, <eol> the immune system creates <eob> a small environment of cells and proteins <eol> that can change the way <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, <eol> just like the <eob> weather <eol> affects our daily activities, like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix <eob> signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of muscle. <eol>
These scaffolds are made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eob> from <eol> plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eol> sponges that are more or less porous, <eol> gels of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers can even make the materials release different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of <eol> cells <eob> by giving them the correct stage, cues and props that can be changed for different tissues, just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop <eol> of Horrors".
I'm combining specific types of signals <eol> that mimic <eol> how our body responds to injury to help us regenerate. <eol>
In the future, we <eob> could see <eol> a <eol> scar-proof band-aid, a moldable muscle filler <eob> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow <eol> and be able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either.
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system <eob> to <eob> help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we <eob> could begin seeing <eol> products on the <eob> market that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, and maybe one <eob> day be able <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank <eob> you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
So, as a child, <eol> I used to spend all of my time <eob> at <eob> my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eob> and stick my face in front of <eol> her only air conditioner.
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing <eol> up, <eob> stories of next-door neighbors having to set <eol> up fake energy accounts <eol> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eol> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter after <eob> their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day. <eol>
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eob> with <eol> impossible choices. <eob>
In the US, the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on energy. <eol>
In <eob> contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, even 30 percent of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eob> 25 million people to skip meals <eol> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy becomes a burden. <eol>
But energy burdens are so much more than just a number. <eol>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible <eol> choice, <eol> and nearly every month, seven million people <eol> choose between medicine and energy. <eol>
This exposes a much larger <eob> and systemic issue.
Families with high energy burdens <eob> are disproportionately people of color, <eol> who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall <eol> into the mass <eob> of 37 million people a year <eol> who are <eob> unable to afford energy <eob> for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have the <eob> tools <eol> to <eob> address <eol> these systemic <eol> inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we approach cost parity, <eol> the <eob> majority of those who own solar <eob> earn much more than the average American. <eol>
This is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eob> of local communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eob>
So we start by working directly with <eob> the communities <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities to learn <eob> about energy poverty, <eol> and how making <eol> even small <eob> updates to their homes <eol> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led smart home research <eol> and installation programs <eob> to help families bring down <eol> their energy bills. <eob>
We're even working directly <eol> with elected officials, advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to <eol> see this vision <eob> of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eol> we have to work together sustainably.
Now, the US <eob> spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance.
And <eol> these programs do help <eol> millions of people, but they're only able to help <eob> a fraction of those <eob> in need. <eob>
In fact, <eol> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy <eob> affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not sustainable.
But by building energy equity <eob> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access to energy that is clean, reliable and affordable.
At scale, microgrid technology, <eob> clean technology and <eob> energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eob> it can help them <eol> reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make ends meet.
This is life-changing.
This <eob> is an opportunity <eol> for families to use their energy savings <eol> to sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eob> and her neighbors, <eol> the impossible <eob> choices that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eob> on our whole community. <eol>
But this is not just about them.
There are millions nationwide having <eob> to make the same impossible choices <eol> today.
And I <eob> know high energy burdens <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through <eob> relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the <eol> paths to overcome them. <eol>
And when we do, <eol> we will <eob> all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock <eol> of birds work together?
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony: Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable is that these birds <eob> would not be able to <eol> do that if they all would have <eol> to follow <eob> one leader.
Their reaction speed <eob> would simply be <eob> too low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these <eob> birds are aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eob> to make autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their <eob> autonomy <eob> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eob> with any one of us? <eol>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eob> I believe to be the most important change that is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster and more complex, <eol> so we need <eol> a new way of <eol> working, <eob> a way that creates <eol> alignment <eol> around <eol> purpose, that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers <eol> people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the question is: <eol> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years <eob> ago, I was working with a bank <eob> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more relevant. <eol>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen a bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate <eob> what many traditional banks look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to go to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with <eob> 20 people <eob> where nothing gets <eol> decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots.
And there are endless handovers <eob> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever. <eol>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have to improve their time to market by drastically changing their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided to go and have a <eol> look at companies that <eob> seem to be more innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.
And I <eol> remember how we were walking <eol> the halls at one of these companies <eol> in December 2014, <eob> a management consultant <eol> and a team of bankers.
We felt like strangers in a strange land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eol> and lots of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eob> "How is your company organized?" And we expected to get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings with funny names like "squads" and "chapters" and "tribes" <eol> to explain how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own <eob> world. <eob>
We asked, "How many people <eol> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eol> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends".
You can imagine our <eob> surprise.
We were asking for what we thought <eob> were some of the basic principles <eol> of organizations, and their answer was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, <eob> over the <eob> course of that <eol> day, <eol> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model.
They believed in the power of small, autonomous teams. <eol>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers <eob> in the same <eob> team <eob> so they could design, build and test ideas with customers <eol> independently of others in the <eob> company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eob> between departments. <eol>
They had all <eob> the <eob> skills needed <eob> right there in <eob> the team.
Now, at the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned. <eol>
And we had started to like their model, <eol> so we were already thinking of how <eol> to <eob> apply some of these ideas <eob> to a bank.
But <eob> then, one of the hosts, a guy who had not said a word all day, <eol> he suddenly said, <eol> "So I see you like our model. <eob>
But I have one question <eob> for <eob> you: <eol> What are you willing to give up?" <eob> What were we willing to give <eob> up? <eol>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we <eol> knew he was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eol> it's about giving up <eol> on some of the old as well.
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their ways of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has their <eob> own skeptics <eob> about why <eol> this is not <eol> going to work for them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> or "They don't have the legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't allow this in our <eob> industry".
But for this bank and also <eol> for the other companies that I have worked with afterwards, <eol> change was possible.
Within <eob> a year, we completely <eol> blew up the old silos between marketing, product, channels and IT.
Three thousand employees were reorganized into 350 multidisciplinary teams.
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just <eob> with <eob> product people and engineers with engineers, a product person and an engineer <eob> were now members of the <eob> same team. <eob>
You could <eol> be <eol> a member of a team <eob> responsible <eob> for account opening <eob> or for <eol> the mobile banking app, etc.
At the go-live date <eol> of that new organization, some people <eob> were shaking hands <eob> for the very first time, <eob> only to find out <eob> that <eob> they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each <eob> other <eol> but they were sending each other emails <eob> and status reports for the last 10 years.
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eob> was always chasing for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're having coffee <eol> together every <eob> day.
If the product guy has an idea, he can just raise it <eol> to get input from the engineer <eob> who is sitting right next to him. <eob>
They <eob> can decide to test <eob> with customers immediately -- <eol> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eol> just getting stuff done.
Now, getting there is not easy. <eob>
And as it <eob> turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to <eob> ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going up and down the organization, <eob> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But <eob> to do <eob> so, we need all the skills <eol> and expertise <eob> for that decision <eol> in the team.
And this brings difficult trade-offs.
Can <eob> we physically co-locate our people <eob> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different countries today? <eol>
Or <eob> should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we <eob> ensure consistency <eob> in the way we do things across these teams?
We still need some kind <eol> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes to structure <eob> and process and procedure -- they are not easy. <eol>
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eol> is our own behavior.
Let me try to illustrate. <eol>
If we want these teams <eol> to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, they have to be empowered and autonomous.
But this means we cannot have leaders commanding their people what to do, when to do, how to do.
No micromanagers.
But it also <eob> means that each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up to <eol> take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all these <eob> teams running in different directions, because that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need <eol> alignment and autonomy <eol> at the same time, just like a flock of birds.
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, and with each new <eob> behavior, <eol> there is giving up on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to <eob> make sure <eob> that everyone in the organization <eol> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why <eol> -- and the overall priorities -- the what. <eol>
But then they have to let <eob> go and trust their teams to make the right decisions on how to <eob> get there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication.
But you know how they say <eol> that information is a source of power? <eol>
Well, for some managers, sharing information may <eob> feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power.
And it's not just managers.
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well.
In these companies, the teams typically work in short sprints, <eol> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eol> to share the output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eol>
And every day, <eob> each member of <eol> the team gives <eol> an update <eob> of what they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable for people, because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eol>
Everything we do <eob> is transparent <eob> for everyone. <eol>
So, alignment <eob> is not easy, and <eob> providing autonomy <eol> is not so <eob> obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eol> likes <eob> to explain how he used to be <eob> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, <eob> today, <eob> to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down to the team floors <eol> to attend one <eob> of their sessions. <eol>
And instead of telling <eob> people what <eob> to do, he looks for ways to help them. <eol>
That is radical change <eob> for <eob> someone who used to be <eob> a master <eob> of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if needed".
And middle managers <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, there's less <eob> of a need <eob> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the old world, there was <eob> this idea of thinkers and doers. <eol>
Employees would just follow <eol> orders.
But now, instead of <eob> only managing other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eob> to become player-coaches.
So imagine, for the last 10 <eol> years, <eob> you have just been telling other people what to do, <eol> but now <eol> you're <eob> expected <eob> to do things yourself again. <eol>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eol> and some great people leave the company. <eob>
But the result is a new culture with less hierarchy. <eol>
And all of this <eol> is hard work.
But it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used <eol> to deploying <eol> new <eob> product features a few times per year.
Now they have releases every few weeks, and without the handovers <eob> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, you just feel a new energy. <eol>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the halls of a <eob> very large start-up. <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eob> they cannot claim victory yet.
But at least with this new model, they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eol>
The world is getting faster and more <eob> complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working.
And the hardest part of that change is not in structure <eol> or <eol> process <eob> or procedure, <eol> and it's also not just <eol> senior executives taking charge.
Leaders will be all of those in the organization <eol> who embrace the change. <eol>
We all have to lead the change. <eol>
So the question <eol> is: <eol> What are you willing to give up? <eol>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A leader is steady, firm, <eol> decisive, unwavering. <eob>
Never let 'em <eob> see you sweat, always have an answer. <eol>
[The <eol> Way We Work] <eol> My name is <eob> Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I created on Instagram. <eol>
As I thought about my double life, <eob> I couldn't help but wonder ... <eob>
When your true self is a little nontraditional, how much of it can you really <eol> bring to the office? <eob>
For <eob> some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eol>
For the first 10 years of my career, I thought there was <eol> one way to be a leader: decisive and serious. <eol>
But that's not me.
So I'd put on basically <eob> office drag to fit the role: I'd talk in a deeper <eob> voice, <eob> try to hold in my hand motions. <eol>
I'm someone who gets <eol> really excited about things, <eob> so I'd temper that. <eob>
I had this little voice <eob> in my head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eob> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had one well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. And that's great. <eol>
But you don't need to beat them over the head with it". <eol>
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eol>
I dressed up <eob> as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eol> thinking my friends <eob> would get a kick out of it.
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first it was pure fun. <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages <eob> from people about how happy it made them, <eob> how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, maybe <eob> this is the time to tell that little voice <eol> in my head to just shut up <eob> and let myself be me. <eol>
But then things got a little too big. <eob>
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere -- In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- and I <eob> got terrified: <eol> "What would my bosses think?
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader?
What would my clients think?" <eol> I thought I <eol> was going to have <eob> to <eob> get a different job.
But then, something happened, something small. <eob>
I got <eol> a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, <eob> it just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that <eol> had just gone up about me.
And it let me put that little, scared voice <eob> away <eob> and just be excited about this whole <eob> new world, <eol> rather than <eol> freaked <eol> out.
That's the power of one person, <eob> sometimes all it takes is one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable.
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, <eob> more playful with me, it was <eol> as if knowing this other side of me <eob> gave them permission <eob> to be more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team.
But it's done the opposite. <eob>
Two years in, I never could have <eob> imagined that this <eol> part of me would not just be embraced, <eob> but could actually help my career.
Now, <eob> I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, in an office where creativity is <eob> valued <eol> and I was already pretty established <eob> in my <eob> career when all of <eob> this started.
Maybe that's <eob> you, maybe it isn't.
But all of this has taught me so <eob> much about just the importance <eol> of bringing your whole self to work. <eol>
And it's really challenged <eob> my own misperceptions <eob> about what it takes to be successful.
There's no one kind of way to be <eol> a <eol> leader. <eob>
It's about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eob> I'd put on my perfect leader mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eob> "Gosh, that was frustrating". <eob>
We can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way, rather than everybody pretending that they're fine until it's too late. <eol>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing <eol> you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to me, though, <eob> is that <eob> in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent <eol> of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion.
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> and all <eol> of our strange <eob> inner <eob> voices have a long way to go on <eob> acceptance.
There's a big difference between adapting and disguising. <eol>
And I think I learned that a <eol> little late. <eob>
Personally, I'm taking all of this <eob> as a call to be <eol> the ally who, like my boss did for me, <eob> lets people know that it's OK to open <eob> up. <eob>
If you're gay, <eob> or <eol> proud <eob> of your ethnic background, <eol> or have a disability <eob> or are deeply religious, <eol> see what it's like <eol> being your full self at work. <eob>
You might be pleasantly surprised.
The basic problem <eol> with working <eob> in an office <eol> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work environment. <eob>
[The Way We Work] <eob> Howdy, my name is Matt, <eol> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, <eol> the company behind WordPress.com, <eob> Jetpack and WooCommerce. <eol>
We're coming up on over 800 employees, <eol> and they live everywhere, <eob> from <eob> California to Alabama, Mississippi, to where I live in Texas. <eob>
They're also in 67 countries. <eol>
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eol>
Some of them choose not even <eob> to have a home base, they're nomads.
Whether they are in RVs <eob> or traveling <eob> through Airbnbs, <eob> they are in <eol> new places every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they <eob> can find <eob> good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eol>
It was a conscious choice from the very beginning. <eol>
Notice I don't use the word "remote," because it sets up the <eob> expectation, <eob> that <eob> some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I <eob> use the word "distributed" to describe what we do, <eol> where everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think <eob> a distributed workforce <eol> is the most effective way to <eob> build a company. <eob>
The key is you <eob> have to approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many of the first 20 hires <eob> were people I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years.
I wanted to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eol>
I <eob> believe that talent <eob> and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not.
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the big tech companies fish <eol> from essentially <eob> the same small pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the <eob> entire ocean.
Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in the world. They bring a different <eol> understanding of that <eol> culture <eol> and a <eol> different lived <eob> experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision <eob> to <eol> go distributed, there's a desire to give <eob> people autonomy over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless you're <eol> in a role where specific hours are important, <eol> you <eol> can make your own schedule.
Everyone can have a corner <eob> office, <eol> their windows, the food <eob> they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music and when there's silence. <eol>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You <eol> can save the time <eob> you'd spend commuting <eol> and put it into things that are important to <eol> you. <eob>
A distributed workforce <eob> is ideal for a technology company. <eob>
But people often ask me, "This works great for y'all, <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eol> If you have <eob> an office, <eob> you can do a few things <eol> to build distributed capability.
First: document <eob> everything. <eol>
In an <eob> office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the moment, in the <eol> kitchen, in the hall.
But if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team are having those conversations they don't have <eol> access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions <eob> being <eob> made <eol> without understanding the why.
Always leave a trail of where you were <eol> and what you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eol>
It allows people in different time zones to interact, <eol> it's also great to think about <eob> as an organization evolves, people leaving and people joining.
Try to have as <eob> much communication <eol> as possible online. <eol>
When <eol> everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new people to <eob> catch <eob> up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools.
There are so many apps and services that help with day-to-day communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management.
The things that changed how you work probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eob> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eob> tools that enable collaboration, see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place 48 weeks out of the <eob> year <eob> and you might have <eob> three or four weeks apart.
We try to flip that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company comes <eob> together for <eob> a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary goal is connecting people. <eol> We want to make <eob> sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eol> and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues.
When they work together <eob> the rest of <eol> the year, <eol> they can bring together <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the final practice: give people the flexibility <eob> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend that they can put <eob> towards a co-working space <eol> or just to buy coffee, so they don't get kicked out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together <eol> and rented <eob> a workspace on a fishing pier. <eol>
Each person who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they <eob> can invest <eol> in getting the right chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eob> the most productive environment <eob> for them. <eol>
Today, there are just a few companies that are distributed <eol> first. <eob>
In a decade or two, I predict that 90 <eol> percent of companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eol> the course of the world <eol> are going to function this way.
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eol>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eol> consider how <eol> you can tap <eol> into global talent, give people autonomy to live and work <eol> where they feel they should <eol> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it is <eob> that you're creating together. <eob>
