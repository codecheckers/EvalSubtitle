For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx tens # xxx <eob> of <eob> these # xxxx expensive images, <eol> like <eol> # AI, <eob> we # <eol> started # xxxx # a xxxxxx # medical image. <eob>

Then # xxxxx billions # of information xxxxxxxx <eob>

to our surprise, <eol> we # only required # xx -- <eob> I xxxxxxx <eol> # <eob> 50 <eob> of composite # images # xx # xxxxx <eol> our # algorithms to # high efficiencies. <eob>
To # approach, <eol> instead of using 10,000 <eol> expensive <eob> can # train <eol> # the AI <eol> an # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxx xxxx # 50 of # these high-resolution, <eol> # standard photographs, acquired # from DSLR <eol> xxx mobile xxxxxxx <eob> diagnosis.

xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> go and have # a # at # companies xxxx # to be # more innovative, <eob> like Netflix, xxxxxxx <eob>
