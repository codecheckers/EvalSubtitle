xxxxxx xxx must answer <eol> xxx question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
xxxxx transformational # teams <eob> combine ambitions <eol> to their xxxxxxx to their xxxxxxxx <eob> and they # develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>

I # work with x remarkable #
xxx name is # Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
xxxx is # health care <eob>
And # xxxx Nuna # founded, <eob> they # used data to serve xxx health xxxxx xx xxxx of workers xx large <eol>
xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, the issued a proposal <eob> to build the # first # ever cloud database for # Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember xxxx # Medicaid # xx # program serves xx # million # Americans, <eob> our poor, # <eol> our children and # disabilities.
Nuna at the # time was xxxx people <eob> xxx this database <eol> to built in year, <eob> they xxx a whole set of <eol> that had to # honor, <eob> and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eol> very <eol> much the xxxxxxxx
This was x # bet-your-company # <eol> moment, <eob> and # Jini xxxxxx it. <eob>
xxxxxx # at # opportunity. She # did flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, it's a xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's # younger brother Kimong # xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx when # he seven, <eob> xx had # first grand xxx xxxxxxx <eob> Disneyland. <eol>
He the ground. stopped breathing. <eob>
xxxxxx # parents are Korean <eob>

She was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
That xxxxxx defined # # xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became her xxxxxxxx <eob> # that company bid on, # won <eol> and on that # <eob>
Here's # to tell # you why. <eob>
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved <eol> my xxxxxx from <eob> today # it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid. <eob>
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx story <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> to be # told with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eob> that a compelling sense why can be the launchpad # for # objectives.
Remember, that's # <eol> xx xxxx to xxxx # <eol> accomplished.
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eob> xxxx # are inspiring, <eob> xxx # they're # x of vaccine <eob> against # # thinking. <eob>
You <eob> think a # rockstar <eob> would # be an unlikely user of Objectives Key Results, <eob> years, xxxx has used OKRs <eob> xx wage x global xxx <eol> against xxxxxxx and disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eol> focused # on two xxxxxx # gorgeous, objectives. <eol>
The # first xx debt relief <eob> for the xxxxxxx countries the world. <eob>
# next xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> anti-HIV # drugs. <eol>
Now, # why xxx these good objectives? <eob>
Let's xx # back to our checklist. <eob>

<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eob>

What # is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is # x stereotype <eob> history should be focused <eob> on xxx # rulers, <eob> like Lenin <eol> Trotsky. <eol>
As a result, <eol> people <eol> in xxxx # # like mine, Russia, <eob> look # <eol> at xx something <eol> xxx # predetermined xx # determined by the leaders, <eob> and common people # xxxxx influence # any <eol>

xx # prove it, I spent years <eob> of my life xxxxxx to go xxx # years xxxxx <eob> to # the <eol> xxxx 1917, <eob> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

So any user our website or application <eob> can follow x news feed for each day xx xxxx <eob> and # read xxxx <eol> like Stravinsky or Lenin xx Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx and felt. <eob>
We # # all # those personalities <eol> being # <eob> like me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we # see that history xxxxxxxx <eol> # their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> not only their xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>

But # if # take xxxxxxx look, <eol> it's not that black and xxxxxx <eob>
1917 led # 70 years <eol> of communist xxxxxxxxxxxxx
But this project, # we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eob> xxx # a # xx any other country could <eol> or still can. <eob>
Reading # the posts 1917, <eob> you learn Russia <eol> was the # first country # world to # abolish the death <eob> # <eob> or # xxx # of xxx first <eol> ones <eol> xx xxxxx # women voting # <eob>
Knowing history and # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> ordinary influenced <eob> # <eol> can # help us # x better xxxxxxx <eob> because history just a <eol> of what's happening xxxxx <eob> now. <eob>
xx do xxxx xxx # ways of telling # and this for example, <eob> we started # a xxx # online project <eol> xxxx is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> that # <eob> that gives an <eol> of that xxxxx xxxxx <eob> a xxxx # xxxxxx by xxxxxx social <eob> that, xx # many ways, created the as we know xx <eob>

By # exposing history <eol> in xxxx # a democratic # way, <eob> through xxxxxx media, <eob> we show xxxx people power <eol> are not xxx only # making choices.

Today, however, <eol> we xxxxx # face # massive challenges <eol> in detecting and xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx <eob> # illnesses, <eob> such # as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of xxxxxxxx every xxxx <eob> lose their lives <eol> due xx # liver and # cancer. <eob>
Our best way xx # help these patients <eob> is # # perform early <eol> and diagnoses xxxxx
So how <eob> do we detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx <eol>
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx # # diseases, <eob> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive <eol> xxxxxxx # imaging technologies as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx to be xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images <eob> and talks to # the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eol> a very <eob> resource-intensive <eob> requiring xxxx # expert physicians, <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and is xxx considered practical <eol> for xxx developing <eob>
And in fact, in # many <eol> industrialized # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem <eol> artificial <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eol> xx # solve this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eob> x repeat, on xx order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical <eob> xx # generated. <eol>
After # xxxxx # then go <eob> # expert physician, <eob> would xxxx <eol> those images xxx xxx <eob>
And those two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train xxxx neural network <eol> xx x xxxx learning network <eob> to provide <eol> xxxxxxxxx diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eol> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same <eob> xxxxxxxx
Large of expert physicians <eol> xxx expert medical imaging # <eob>
So, # can we invent xxxx scalable, effective <eob> and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important <eol> problems # facing us xxxxxx <eob>
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented # a of AI # architectures <eob> to # solve some of the most important <eol> us today <eol> in xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials. <eob>
In xxxxxxx shared xxxx # you # had two goals. <eob>
xxx first goal # xx <eob> the # of <eob> to <eob> train <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx we xxxxxx <eol> of # technologies xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So how # xxx we do it? <eol>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of xxxxxxxx <eol> with tens xxx thousands <eol> xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx <eol> # traditional AI, <eob> we started # with # <eob> single medical image. <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way <eob> xx # extract # billions <eol> of information <eob>
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eol> on the <eob>
In a sense, # we converted # one <eol> xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, <eob> massively reducing xxx amount of needed # for training. <eob>
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, we started with a # standard, <eob> xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eob> the <eol> # medical onto this image, <eob> creating something <eol> we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- <eob> xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to xxxx efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of 10,000 <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, we # now # train the AI algorithms <eol> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using only <eol> 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eob> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the and even <eob> some very simple, # white light photographs xxxx the patient, <eol> instead of expensive <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era <eob> xxxxx # <eob> intelligence <eol> is going xx make # incredible <eob> on our xxxxxxx <eob>
And think <eob> that # thinking <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx # <eob> which # is data-rich but # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> should # also continue thinking <eol> unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> xxxxx xxx accept small xxxxxxx of data and solve some # of xxx most important <eol> problems facing # <eob> today, <eol> especially in # # care.

discovered a xxxxxxxx of # immune cell, the T xxxxx <eob> was <eol> that material that x xxxxxxxxx <eol> and # absolutely for wound healing. <eol>
Now, # just # when xxx were # a kid <eol> xxx you'd break your pencil <eob> xxx <eob> # tape back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eob> but it might not be <eol> in # most functional way, <eob> xxx we'll a scar. <eol>
# if we xxxxx have these helper T xxxxxx <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, <eol> xxx develops fat <eob> cells xxxxxx # of # <eol> xxx if there's # fat our muscle, <eol> it isn't xx # <eol>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our # xxxx grow # <eol> xxxxxxx # these scars <eol> look # # what # it <eob> we were # even injured. <eol>
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create <eob> that <eob> # give us the signals <eol> # <eob> by changing the <eob> response. <eob>
We xxxx that # x # xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx in xxxxx <eob> xxx xxxxxx system will # <eob> to # it.
This # ranges # xxxx # pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> the xxxxxxxxx that # engineers are using <eol> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx
xx when I place that # material, <eob> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system <eol> x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eol> that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave. <eob>
Now, # just like # xxx # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eob> like going for x run or staying inside # and # <eol> entire # xx show # on Netflix, <eob> the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop. <eob>
xx we have the xxxxx signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we fat cells instead of xxxxxxx <eob>
These # scaffolds made <eol> of a variety different things, <eob> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges <eol> # that xxx # more or less # porous, <eob> xxxx # of different stiffnesses. <eob>
xxx # <eol> can even make the materials <eob> xxxxxxx # different signals xxxx time.
So in other # <eob> words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> this Broadway of cells <eob> by them # xxx stage, xxxx # <eob> that # xxx be changed for # different xxxxxxxx <eob> just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set <eob> for # "Les # "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> specific types of <eob> signals <eol> that how # our # body responds to <eol> to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see <eob> a # xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eol> xx even <eol> a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we # aren't xxxxx to up <eol> xxx heal xxxx Wolverine. <eob>
xxxxxxxx not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with xxxxx advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx with # our immune xxxxxx <eol> help # tissue xxx heal wounds, we could xxxxx seeing xxxxxxxx xxx market <eob> that # # body's defense system <eob> help us regenerate, <eol> maybe # xxx xxx xx able xx # keep # xxxx a xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

A few # ago, # I was working a bank <eob> that to embark on a transformation. <eob>

Now, I'm # not sure how <eol> many of you have # # from # the # inside, so let me # try # <eob> to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eob>

You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx

And there are <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting done forever.
xx this xxxx knew <eol> xxxx in # xxxxx to <eob> they would have # to improve <eol> their time to xxxxxx by drastically changing <eol> working xx <eol>
But how? <eol>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eob> to xx and have # a look at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, <eob> like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, <eob> # Zappos.
I remember how we were walking <eol> halls <eob> at # xxx # of <eob> in 2014, <eob> a # management <eol> and a of bankers. <eol>
We felt # strangers in # land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eob> and lots xx smart, # employees. <eob>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How <eol> # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange <eob> xxxx # names like xxxxxxxx <eob> and and "tribes" <eob> to # explain # how they xxxx organized. <eob>
So then we tried to # <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working xxx you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
xxxx you <eob> report to?" <eol> "It <eol>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that <eol> xx gained a # better <eol> understanding xx xxxxx model. <eol>
They believed the # <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
xxxxx teams like <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and IT engineers in the team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers independently of others the company. <eob>
xxxx did not <eob> need xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eol> we # xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxxx on what xx had learned. <eob>
And # we xxx # started <eol> to # like xxxxx model, <eob> so # we # already # of how to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not # xxxx a word all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eob>
But I have for you: <eob> What are you willing to # give xxxx <eol> What were we willing xx <eol> give up? <eob>

Within a # year, we completely xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, channels xxx IT. <eob>

You could be a member of # a xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx <eob> or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, etc. <eob>
At xxx # date <eol> of that organization, <eob> people # xxxx # shaking # hands <eol> for the # # xxxxx time, <eob> only to xxxx out xxxx they xxx <eol> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other <eob> but # # were each # other emails <eol> and # status reports for the last 10 #

If we # want these # teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> have be # xxxxxxxxx xxx autonomous. <eob>
# this means xx # cannot leaders commanding their people what # to xxx <eob> when # xx do, how <eol> to xxx <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
# it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eol> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's <eob> about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up xx take <eob>
obviously, <eol> xx also <eob> xx have all # these teams # in different directions, <eob> xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment and <eob> autonomy at the # xxxx <eob> xxxxx <eob> just a birds. <eob>

Well, # some managers, <eob> may feel xx if <eol> they're giving up xxxx source xx power. <eol>

I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where # everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think # a workforce <eob> is the # <eol> most effective xxx <eol> to build x # company. <eob>

When # xx started WordPress, many # of # the first 20 xxxxx <eol> were I'd never # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to # <eol> continue # that <eol> xxx simple reason. <eob>
I believe that # talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> # world. But opportunity # not. <eob>
In Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the <eol> small # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eob> can # fish from the entire ocean. <eob>

you're a <eob> # <eol> where specific hours are <eob> you can make # your xxx schedule. <eob>
Everyone xxx <eob> have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx windows, <eol> the food they want # eat, <eob> xxx # choose xxxx # music <eol> and # # # silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx what temperature <eob> the <eob> room xxxxxx # be. <eob>
You can save the xxxx <eol> you'd # spend <eol> # commuting <eob> and put it xxxx # things <eob> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company. <eob>
But often ask me, "This <eob> # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, <eol> about # everyone xxxxxx <eob> If you xxxx an office, <eob> xxx can do # # things to distributed capability.
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In xx office, it's easy <eob> to xxxx decisions in the moment, <eob> the kitchen, in the <eol>
if people work remotely and some members of the <eol> are xxxxx they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made <eol> understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave # of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about.
This <eob> # allows <eob> others # # pick up <eol> where left off. <eol>
allows people in <eob> different time zones to xxxxxxxxx <eob> also great to # think about <eol> as an organization <eob> people xxxxxxx and people joining. <eob>
Try # have # as much # communication <eob> possible xxxxxxx <eob>
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eob>
You need to xxxx the right tools. <eob>
are many xxxx and services <eob> that with # day-to-day communication, <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that # changed xxx you xxxx <eol> probably aren't # xxxxxxx # anymore. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your #
So experiment with different <eob> xxxxx collaboration, <eob> see # what works. <eob>
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, you're in the # same place <eob> 48 # weeks # <eob> out of # the year <eob> and # might <eob> # or # four apart. <eob>
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. <eob> Once a year xx xxxxx # meet-up <eob> xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx for week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
xxx goal is # people. <eob> # want <eob> to sure <eol> everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> and # have a # deeper connection <eob> with their colleagues. <eol>
When work # together <eob> rest of the year, <eob> they together <eol> that # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the xxxxx practice: <eol> give people flexibility <eol> to make their xxx work environment. <eob>

One in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented <eob> a # xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing xxxxx
Each person who # # the company <eol> gets a <eob>
This is money they # can invest <eol> in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, <eob> xxx # desk so <eob> # xxxx have <eol> the most productive environment xxx them.
xxxxxx there # just a # few companies that are xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # xxxx I xxxxxxx that <eob> percent of companies <eol> are # # changing <eob> xxx course of the world <eob> are going # to # this # way. <eol>
They will # evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eol> they'll be replaced by those xxxx <eob>
As you # xxxxx about <eol> xxxxx <eob> to xxxxx next, <eob> consider how xxx can tap <eol> into # global talent, <eob> xxxx # people autonomy to live where they feel they # should <eob> participate <eob> # fully in whatever <eol> it is # xxxx you're creating
