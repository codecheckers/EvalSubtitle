For our xxxxx goal, instead # xx starting tens <eob> and # thousands <eob> xx these very # expensive # medical <eol> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started <eob> with a # xxxxxxx image. <eol>

A few ago, x <eob> was with x xxxx <eob> wanted to <eol> on x # <eob>
They <eob> wanted their to simpler, <eob> more more # relevant.
Now, xxx not xxx # many of <eob> # you <eol> have seen x <eob> from the # xxxxxxx <eob> so xx try # to illustrate what many traditional <eol> # banks xxxx like. <eol>
xxx see # lots xx # people suits <eob> taking elevators to <eob> # go <eol> to # department, <eol> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with etc. <eob>
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people <eol> where <eob> gets xxxxxxxx
ideas? They end # <eob> up <eob> xx PowerPoint parking lots.
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can take xxxxxxxx <eob>
So this <eob> bank knew <eol> xxxx in # # transform, <eol> xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx <eol> their time xx # market drastically changing their # # of # # <eol> xx well.
But how? <eob>
xx # get some xxxxxxx xx # xx and # # <eob> a look # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to xx more # innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, # <eol> Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
xxx I remember how <eob> # we # <eob> the # halls at <eob> # these companies <eob> xx # December 2014, <eob> a management # consultant and x # team of bankers. <eol>
xxxx # strangers # a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # xxx <eol> xxxx of smart, <eol> creative employees.
So xxxx we # asked, <eob> "How xx your company organized?" <eol> And xx expected xx xxx xx org <eob>
xxx instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx drawings <eob> xxxx # funny xxxxx like # xxxxxxxx and "chapters" # "tribes" <eob> xx explain how were organized. <eob>
So then # we tried <eob> translate <eol> xxxx <eol> our # own <eob> world. <eol>
We asked, "How many xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx <eol> # you?" # depends".
# <eob> do # report <eob>
"Who xxxxxxx <eol> on # priorities?" <eob> "It <eol>
You xxx <eol> # imagine # our
We # were # asking xxx <eol> some <eob> # the basic <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> of organizations, and answer xxxx <eol> xxx depends".
Now, course # of <eol> that xxxx <eob> gained # a # better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their <eol>
They in <eol> xxx power xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eol>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups.
had # # people <eol> and # engineers # in the same team so they could # design, # <eol> build <eol> and test <eob> ideas # customers <eol> independently of others xx the company.
xxxx # did xxxx # handovers <eol> # <eob>
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed <eob> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, # at the of that <eol> x # session <eob> # reflect xx <eob> what xx had # <eob> learned. <eob>
# we xxx # started to # their # model, <eol> so xx were thinking of how <eol> xxxxx some of # these ideas <eob> xx a # xxxxx <eol>
But then, one # of hosts, <eob> a who said # a # all day, <eob> xx suddenly said, xxx you <eol> xxx xxxxxx <eol>
But x have one <eol> question you: <eob> What xxx willing <eol> # to # xxxx up?" <eob> xxxx xx <eol> xxxxxxx to # give up?
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, <eol> but # we xxxx he was right. <eob>
# xx not # only <eob> embracing the <eol> it's about up <eob> some of # xxx old as well. <eol>
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx <eob> # <eol> have # with companies <eob> xxxx xxx # xxxxx to # xxxxxx <eob> ways of # working. <eob>
xxxxxxxx # every company has their xxx skeptics <eol> about why # this # is not going # xx work # for # <eol>
xxxx # product is # more <eob> complex," or "They don't xxxx the legacy # <eob> IT like do," <eol> "Regulators # just won't allow <eob> this <eol> xx # our industry".
But for this # also xxx # companies that x xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> was possible. <eob>
x # <eob> we completely xxxx # up old silos <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxx channels # and IT. <eob>
Three thousand <eob> employees xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol>
So instead of product xxxxxx <eol> sitting xxxx <eol> xxxx product people <eob> and engineers # with engineers, <eob> a product person # xx <eob> engineer were members of # same xxxxx
xxx xxxxx # xx # member of # <eol> a team <eol> responsible <eob> account # opening <eob> or for the # mobile banking xxxx etc.
At xxxxxxx date <eob> that # new xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # people <eol> were shaking <eob> # xxxxx <eol> for # xxx very first <eob> only # # find # out <eob> that they had been <eob> sitting two minutes away # xxxx # each # <eob> but they <eob> were sending <eob> each # <eob> other <eol> emails <eob> xxx status # xxx the # last # 10 <eob> # <eol> years. <eob>
# would xxxx someone saying, <eol> # xx you're the guy that <eob> was for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
now, # they're # xxxxxx <eob> together # every <eob>
If the product # # an # xxxxx he # xxxx xxxxx it <eob> to # get input from # the engineer <eol> who # xxxxxxx xxxx <eob>
can decide to # test <eol> with xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> no # xx PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just # <eob> getting xxxxx done.
# getting <eob> # is xxx easy. <eob>
And as it turns out, "What # you # willing # to # xxxx # up?" <eol> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous # <eol> requires # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions <eob> going up and down the organization, we <eol> want # xxxx # # decide. <eol>
But # <eol> to xx so, xxxx all the skills <eol> xxx expertise # for that decision <eol> in <eol>
# this brings trade-offs. <eob>
# we physically xxx xxxxxx who are in different buildings, <eol> xxxxxxxxx cities xx even xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eol>
Or # xx in <eob> # better videoconferencing? <eol>
xxx do we # xxxxxx <eob> in # the way we do xxxxxx these teams? <eob>
We xxxxx xxxx # <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx matrix.
# xxx # <eob> these xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx and process # <eol> and xx they # <eob> not xxxxx <eob>
But the xxxx <eob> I xxxxx # that # # most <eol> difficult # xx # <eob> change <eob> is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx me try <eob>
xxxx # these teams # be fast, <eob> flexible, # # x # <eob> they xxxx to # be empowered xxx autonomous. <eol>
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx leaders commanding <eob> # their # people what to # xxx when to do, how # <eol> xx <eol>
No # micromanagers.
But it means that each employee <eol> xxxxx # xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # formal xxxxxx <eol>
xxxx xxxxx xxx <eob> xxxxxxxx # xx <eob> xx xxxx initiative.
# xxxxxxxxxx xx # xxxx cannot afford <eob> xxxx all # these teams in xxxxxxxxx directions, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxx would <eob> certainly <eob> # lead to chaos.
we # and xxxxxxxx <eol> at # same xxxxx just # xxxx <eol> flock # of birds. <eol>
an <eob> organizational # setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, <eob> xxx with xxxx behavior, there is up on <eol> # old well. <eob>
Leaders # xxxx to make sure <eol> xxxx everyone in the organization <eol> is xxxxxxx # around <eol> the <eol> purpose xx the <eob> # why -- <eob> the overall <eol> # priorities -- xxx # xxxxx
then # have to let # go <eob> and <eol> # xxxx the right decisions <eob> # how # to get there.
Now, creating <eob> xxxxxxxxx requires <eob> open # xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication. <eol>
But you know # how they <eob> # xxx <eol> that # information # source # of power? <eol>
xxxxx for some # managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if <eol> # giving # <eob> up that xxxxxx of # power. <eol>
And it's just # xxxxxxxxx <eol>
teams <eol> xxxxxx and # xx # well. <eob>
xx xxx # teams <eol> typically # xxxx xxxxx <eob> and xx # end of # every sprint, <eol> they organize # a <eol> xxxx # <eol> to share the of <eol> what <eob> done, # transparently. <eol>

Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable # for # people, <eol> because # suddenly, there <eol> xx xxxxx to hide # anymore.
Everything we xxx everyone. <eol>
So, is xxx # <eob> and # is not # # either.
One # executive # <eol> likes # xx how xx <eob> xxxx to be <eol> a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, today, to # xxxx how # are # going, <eol> instead # of xxxxxxx at status # reports, he # needs to walk # # # # xxxx floors <eob> one of # their sessions. <eol>
instead of # people xxxx to do, he looks # ways to # help # them. <eol>
xxxx is change <eob> for # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eol> # <eol> xxxxxx of milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in # the old world, xxxx executive xxxxx <eob> "I only the xxxxxxxx control. <eob>

Now I have much more transparency, and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> earlier xxxxxxxx <eol>
