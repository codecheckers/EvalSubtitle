Imagine waking up # <eob> to a stranger -- sometimes <eob> # multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for <eob> something that you wrote online, waking up to an angry message, <eob> and <eob> worried for <eob> your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world <eol> of cyberharassment. <eol>
kind <eob> of harassment that women <eol> face in Pakistan is serious <eol> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is # the sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eol> with 140 million people having access to technologies, <eol> and 15 percent internet penetration.
And this number doesn't seem to go down with the # rise xx new technologies.
Pakistan <eob> is also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their bodies; where men xxx allowed to # disrespect <eob> women <eol> and even kill them sometimes <eol> in the name so-called "family <eol> honor"; <eol> where # women are xxxx <eol> to die right xxxxxxx <eol> their houses <eol> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very # clearly: <eob> it's not honor; it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder.
I come from a very xxxxx village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where <eob> women are # allowed <eol> to pursue their xxxxxx <eob> education. <eob>
The elders of my xxxxxxxx family <eol> didn't allow their women <eol> to <eob> pursue their # education xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike other <eob> male guardians of my family, my father was one who really supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get xx law degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there # were] frowns of disapproval. <eob>
But xx end, I knew <eol> it's either me or # them, and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My family's traditions <eob> and expectations <eol> for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a <eob> mobile <eol> phone until I was married.
And even when I xxx married, <eob> this tool xxxxxx x tool <eol> for my # own surveillance.
When # I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he # really didn't approve of <eob> and threw me out <eob> of house, <eob> with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
And that was the # time when I first asked # myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same <eol> equal xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution?
While the states that # a <eol> woman <eob> has same equal access <eob> to the information, <eol> why <eol> # <eob> xx it always men -- brothers, <eob> fathers and husbands -- <eob> xxx # <eol> are granting these rights to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the law irrelevant?"
So I decided to <eol> take a step, <eob> instead of keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal <eol> and societal norms. <eob>
And founded the Digital <eol> Foundation in <eol> 2012 <eob> to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces and cyberharassment.
From lobbying free and safe internet to convincing young women <eol> that access to xxx safe internet is their fundamental, basic, right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have bothered <eob> me all these years. <eol>
With <eol> a hope xx my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, <eol> I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- <eol> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the <eob> women <eol> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online.
I think of the xxxxx who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma when they unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go about their # daily activities, thinking that there <eob> is <eob> a rape threat in their <eob> in-box.
Safe access # to the internet <eol> is access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom.
When <eob> I # fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting for equality.
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical moment. <eol>
leaders, <eob> some of our great <eob> institutions <eob> are failing us.

In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, <eob> but often, <eol> xxxxxxx us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
this is unacceptable.
This has xx stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs? <eol>
How are we going <eol> to # choose <eob> the <eol> right course? <eob>
It's not xxxxx <eob> to be easy. <eol>
For years, I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams <eol> they've # chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today # I'm going to share with you <eob> what really a difference -- that's what's crucial, <eol> how and they set meaningful and audacious xxxxxx <eob> the # right goals # for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's <eob> go back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eol>
I've got a lot to learn, a <eob> computer engineer, <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest manager <eob> of his or xxx other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also <eob> a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, it almost <eob> doesn't matter what you <eob> xxxxx <eob>
Execution <eob> xx what matters the most". <eob>
And <eob> so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and # Key Results". <eob>
kind xx rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
Andy <eob> Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management xx # <eob> systems <eol> xxx the objectives and xxx key <eob> results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction.
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at <eol> the xxx you can look <eol> and without any argument <eol> say, <eob> "Did I # <eol> do <eob> that, or did I do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
Objectives <eol> and Key Results, <eob> or xxxxx <eol> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for organizations, xxxx work for teams, they even work xxx individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm <eob> going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us <eob> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them.
They ship their sales, <eol> they <eob> introduce their new products, they make their numbers, <eol> but xxxx lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the right way? <eob>
First, you must answer the question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eol>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose, <eob> and they develop a # clear <eob> and compelling of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a called xxxxx <eob>
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when was <eob> # founded, <eol> they used data to serve the health needs <eol> of xxxx of xxxxxxx at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's # life, the xxxxxxx government issued a proposal to build the first ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our poor, <eob> our children <eob> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Nuna at <eol> the time was just 15 <eol> people <eob> this database <eol> had to xx built in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set <eob> of commitments <eol> xxxx they had <eob> to honor, and they weren't # going to make <eol> very money on the <eob> project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
xx fell to the ground. <eob> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's <eob> parents are Korean immigrants. <eol>
They came <eol> to the country with limited resources speaking <eob> little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini <eob> to xxxxxx family in Medicaid.
She # was nine years # old.
That moment defined her mission, <eol> and # that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won and delivered on # that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: <eol> saved <eob> # my from bankruptcy, <eob> xxx today it # provides xxx health and for millions of others. <eol>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with # dignity. <eob>
JD: # And Jini's # story tells us that a <eob> compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # significant, <eol> they're action-oriented, <eol> they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a # kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eol>
You think a rockstar <eol> would be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key <eob> Results, but for years, <eol> has used OKRs <eol> to # wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx ONE <eol> has focused on two really gorgeous, audacious objectives.
The first is debt relief <eob> for the <eob> poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eol>
Significant? # Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> xxxx you to do? <eol>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect <eob> rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eol>
The OKR framework cultivates the <eob> madness, <eob> the chemistry contained # inside it. <eol>
It gives <eob> xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, <eol> for trust, <eol> failing is not a # fireable offense. <eol>
And when you have that <eob> sort of structure and environment <eol> and the right people, magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right # around <eol> the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats # of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eol>
Remember, the hows are the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound.
They're xxxxxxxxxx <eob> but realistic. <eol>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eol>
Those # are <eob> good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eob> to Google's <eol> cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
# they are, <eol> 24 <eob> years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them. <eob>
not quite. <eob>
What # he really said was, <eob> "We # have any other way <eob> to manage this <eob> company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". (Laughter) <eob>
And I took that xx a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every since then, <eol> every Googler <eol> has written # down <eol> her objectives her key results. <eob>
They've <eol> graded <eob> them, <eol> and they've <eob> published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And <eob> these are not used <eol> for bonuses or # for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, and that's get collective commitment to # truly stretch goals. <eob>
In xxxxx a <eob> Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took <eol> on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> the future web -- <eob> in other words, build the browser. <eol>
He was thoughtful about how he chose his key <eol> results. <eol>
How xx you measure the xxxx # browser? <eob>
It could # be # ad clicks or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide Chrome <eob> is a great browser or <eol> not.
he had <eob> this one <eol> objective: <eob> build # the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eob> he stuck to the <eob> same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal # was <eob> 20 million users <eol> and he missed it.
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second # year, he raised <eob> the bar to 50 <eol> million. <eob>
He # got to # 37 # million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third # year, <eol> he upped the # ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eob> improved the technology, kaboom!
He got 111 <eob>
Here's why I # like <eob> this story, not so much for # the happy <eol> ending, <eob> but it # shows someone <eob> carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after <eol> year. <eol>
It's a # perfect story for a nerd like me. <eol>
Now, <eob> I think of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eol> that # <eol> are made from the whats <eol> and <eob> hows of our ambitions. <eol>
What really matters is the why <eob> that pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's why we <eob> xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet.
They're not # going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong <eob> culture or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are <eob> in place, <eob> they can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eol> about your life for <eob> # a moment.
Do you have <eol> the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, <eol> your objectives and your # key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like <eol> some feedback on them, <eob> you can send # to # me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eob> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for everyone, <eol> ending global <eob> poverty, access # to all the world's information.
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is today by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've <eob> xxxx called <eol> the <eob> Johnny Appleseed <eob> of OKRs spreading the good gospel <eol> according <eob> to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's xxxxx # for # what it is <eob> that really matters, because we can take xxxx <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them # to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to our # governments. <eol>
We can hold those governments accountable.
We # can transform # those informations.
We can get back on right track <eob> if xx can and do measure <eob> what really <eob> matters. <eol>
Thank # you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What <eol> is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype <eob> that history <eob> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a <eol> result, people <eob> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eol> xxxx # at # history # as something <eol> that was predetermined or determined by the leaders, <eob> and <eob> xxxxxx people could not <eob> influence it in any way. <eol>
Many Russians xxxxx # do not believe <eob> that # Russia <eol> could ever have been <eob> or ever will be <eol> # x truly democratic nation, <eob> and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed <eob> to <eol> the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my # life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to year 1917, <eol> the year of the Russian <eob> Revolution. <eob>
I <eob> asked # myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last # year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, named <eob> Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all real diaries and letters written by # more than 3,000 people <eol> 100 years ago. <eol>
So any user of <eob> our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> can follow a news feed <eob> for each day of 1917 <eol> and <eob> read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova <eob> and others thought and <eob> felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like # you and me, <eob> not demigods, and # we see that history <eob> consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eol> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eob> used to that our country has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas xx freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eol> just because <eob> was not <eob> our destiny. <eol>
But if we take a broader # look, <eob> it's <eob> not that black # and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 led to # <eol> 70 years <eol> of communist # dictatorship.
But with this <eob> project, we xxx that Russia <eol> could <eob> have had a different <eol> history <eob> xxx a democratic future, <eol> as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eob> was the first country in world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or one of first ones <eob> to grant women rights.
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary <eob> # people influenced history <eob> can help us create # better future, <eob> because history is just # a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, <eob> xx started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, and that is an online documentary series that gives <eob> you an impression <eob> of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by global social # change <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created <eol> the world as we know it now. <eob>
But we are <eob> making xxxx <eol> history alive by xx all the main <eob> xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eol> just <eob> like that? <eob>
And we see that a # lot individuals were facing the same challenges <eob> and were fighting <eol> for the same values, <eol> matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR or in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social <eob> media, <eob> we show that people power are not the only ones making choices. <eol>
That gives any user a possibility of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, philosophers # matter. <eol>
We shape society. <eob>
We all make <eob> history.
Thank <eob> you.
(Applause)
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing <eol> incredible tasks with high accuracies, at # a massive <eob> scale, <eol> using human-like # <eol> intelligence. <eol>
And <eob> intelligence of computers <eol> is # often referred xx as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in the future.
Today, however, <eob> we still face massive challenges <eol> in detecting diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eol> such as # infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands patients every year lose xxxxx lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eol>
Our # way to these patients <eob> is # to perform early <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eol>
So how <eob> do we detect <eob> # these diseases today, <eol> xxx # artificial intelligence help?
In patients # who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eol> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the xxxxxxxx <eob>
As xxx can see, this is <eol> a very <eob> resource-intensive xxxxxxxx <eob> requiring <eob> both expert physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is not considered practical <eol> for the developing world.
And # fact, many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can we solve this problem using intelligence?
Today, if I were to use traditional <eob> artificial # intelligence to solve this problem, <eob> I xxxxx <eob> require 10,000 <eob> -- <eol> I repeat, on <eob> an order of 10,000 <eob> of <eol> these very medical images <eol> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, x would xxxx go <eob> to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eol> those images for me. <eob>
And <eob> using those two pieces of <eob> information, <eob> I xxx train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning network <eol> to provide <eob> patient's diagnosis. <eol>
Similar xx # first approach, <eob> traditional <eob> artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from <eob> the same problem. <eol>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert medical imaging technologies.
So, can we # more scalable, <eob> effective and more valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures to solve these very important <eol> problems facing # us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at xxx Media Lab does. <eob>
We <eob> have invented a variety <eob> of unorthodox AI architectures to some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today <eol> in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In the example I shared <eob> with you today, had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal was to reduce the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial <eob> intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted # to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eol>
For our <eol> first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eob> with tens and thousands <eol> of these very expensive images, like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eob> figured out a <eob> clever way <eol> to extract billions <eob> of information packets.
These information packets included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eol> xxx rendering of the disease on the medical image. <eol>
In a sense, we converted one image <eob> xxxx billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for training. <eob>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive imaging technologies to screen # patients, <eob> we started with # a standard, <eob> xxxxx light photograph, <eol> acquired either from a <eob> DSLR camera xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those xxxxxxxx of information packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, creating something <eob> that we call x composite image.
Much to our surprise, <eob> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images <eob> to xxxxx <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of # using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical we # <eol> can now train the AI algorithms <eob> in an unorthodox way, using only 50 # of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eol> and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, our algorithms can accept, in the and even right now, <eob> xxxx # very simple, white <eob> light photographs from the <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging <eob> technologies. <eol>
I xxxxxxx that we are to enter an era <eob> where <eol> artificial intelligence <eol> is <eob> going to make an incredible <eob> impact xx our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of data <eol> and solve some of the most important problems facing us today, especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very <eol> much.
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just getting over # a cold, <eob> you heal your wounds faster?
Today, if we xxxx an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for <eol> weeks, and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, <eol> uninjured organs.
I work to materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give us <eol> the signals to <eob> grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct our body to # fight disease, <eol> we # could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eol> to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds.
Now, regrowing body parts <eob> out of nowhere <eob> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are xxxxxxx organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat.
lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and even # us mere humans <eol> can regrow our # liver <eob> after xxxxxx <eob> more than half of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic a bit closer to reality, <eol> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and <eol> build tissue <eob> through instructions <eob> from <eob> the xxxxxx system.
From a scrape on <eob> your knee <eol> to that <eol> annoying sinus infection, <eol> our <eol> immune system defends <eol> our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to <eol> identify key players in our fight to build back our <eob> cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being # tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that <eol> after treating <eob> an injured # muscle with these materials, <eol> there # was <eob> a large number of immune cells in that xxxxxxxx <eol> the surrounding muscle.
So in this case, <eol> of # the immune cells rushing off <eol> towards to fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing <eol> toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eob> type of immune cell, <eol> the helper T xxxxx <eob> was # present inside <eob> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just like xxxx you were a kid <eob> and you'd break your pencil <eob> and try and tape it back together again, we can heal, <eol> but # it might not be <eol> in # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eol>
So if we <eol> don't have these helper # T cells, instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat <eob> cells xxxxxx xx it, and xx there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eol> without these # scars <eol> and look like # what xx was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to xxxxxx materials <eol> that give us # the signals to <eob> build new tissue <eol> by changing <eol> the immune response. <eob>
We know that xxx <eob> time <eol> a material is <eol> implanted in our body, <eol> the # immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers <eob> are using <eol> to try and build new
So when <eol> I # place that material, <eob> or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the <eob> immune system creates <eob> x small environment of cells and proteins <eol> that can <eob> change the way <eob> that our stem cells behave.
Now, like the weather <eob> affects # our <eol> daily activities, <eob> like going for a run <eol> or staying inside and binge-watching <eob> xx entire <eob> TV xxxx on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that xxx stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If <eol> we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eol> we <eol> get fat cells instead of # muscle.
These scaffolds made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eob> from plastics to naturally <eol> derived <eob> materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that more or less porous, <eob> gels # of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And <eol> researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eol> release different xxxxxxx over time. <eob>
So in other words, <eob> we can orchestrate this Broadway <eob> show of cells by giving # them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eol> that # can be changed for different tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors".
I'm combining specific types <eob> of xxxxxxx <eob> that mimic how our body responds to xxxxxx <eol> to help us regenerate. <eol>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eol> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, we aren't going to up tomorrow <eol> and xx able to heal like Wolverine. <eol>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eol>
But with <eob> these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system <eob> to help build <eob> tissue and heal wounds, we could begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eob> xxxx work with our <eob> body's defense <eob> system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be xxxx <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
<eob>
So, xx a child, <eol> I xxxx # to spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eol> and stick my face in front xx <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door # neighbors <eob> having to # set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have <eol> no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eol> after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eob> comfortable for one more xxxx
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the average American spends <eol> three percent of # their income on energy. <eol>
In contrast, # low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend xxx even 30 percent <eol> of their income energy.
In 2015, this caused over 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy becomes a # burden. <eol>
xxx energy burdens are so much more than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child to get xxx flu medicine, <eol> or # do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible choice, <eol> and # every month, seven million people choose between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and <eol> xxxxxxxx issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people # of color, who spend more per <eol> foot than # their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also <eob> nurses, veterans <eol> and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into <eob> the mass of <eob> 37 million people a year who are unable to afford energy <eob> for <eol> their most basic needs.
As a <eob> result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater xxxxxxxxxx of xxxxxxxxxx <eol> like heart and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets <eob> to Mars and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we have the tools to address xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is xxxxx <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eob> are xxx decreasing. <eol>
However, even as we # cost parity, <eol> the majority of those who own solar earn <eob> much more than # xxx average American. <eol>
xxxx is why, when I was <eob> 22, I founded <eob> the # nonprofit <eob> RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by working with # communities, <eol> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike <eob> xx provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology.
But there's no one way to solve this. <eol>
I believe in the power of xxxxx communities, <eol> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eob>
So we start by working directly with the communities <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops and events for communities <eob> to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eob> updates to their homes like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eol> can go long way to <eob> maximize efficiency.
We're connecting neighborhoods to # community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart <eob> home research <eol> and installation programs to help families bring down their energy <eol> bills.
even working directly <eol> with <eob> elected officials, advocating xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eob> because see this vision <eol> of energy equity and resilience succeed, have to work together sustainably.
US spends over three xxxxxxx # a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eob> millions of people, but they're only able to help <eob> a fraction those in need. <eol>
In fact, there is a 47-billion-dollar <eob> home-energy affordability gap, <eol> xx assistance <eob> alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But by building energy equity and <eob> resilience into # our <eob> communities, we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy # that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency dramatically improve public health. <eol>
And for those with high xxxxxx burdens, <eol> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income <eob> -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income who's struggling <eob> to make # ends meet.
xxxx # is <eob> life-changing.
This is an opportunity <eol> for # to # use their energy savings <eol> sponsor their future. <eob>
I <eob> think back to my great-grandmother <eol> and her neighbors, <eol> the impossible choices <eol> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eob> on our whole community.
But this is not just about them.
There millions nationwide having to # make the same <eob> impossible <eob> choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy are <eob> a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to them.
And when we do, <eob> we will all <eob> be more resilient.
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock <eol> of # birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eob> flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating?
What I find remarkable that # these birds would not be able to do that <eob> if they <eob> all would have <eob> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eol> would simply <eob> be too low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eol> allowing every single <eob> bird <eol> to <eob> autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Their alignment # enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eol>
Now, what <eob> does this have to do with any one of us? <eob>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eob> I believe to be the <eob> most important xxxxxx <eol> that is needed in ways <eob> of working today. <eob>
The world is getting <eol> xxx more # complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that creates <eob> around purpose, <eol> that takes out bureaucracy <eol> and <eol> that truly empowers people to make decisions # faster. <eol>
But the question is: In order to get there, <eol> what are we willing to give up? <eol>
A few years ago, I was xxxxxxx with <eob> a bank <eob> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They wanted their offering to be <eob> more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen <eol> a bank from the so me try to # illustrate <eob> what many traditional xxxxx look like.
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators <eol> to # go to their department, <eol> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers engineers, etc. <eob>
You see <eob> meetings with 20 people <eol> where # nothing decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up in PowerPoint parking lots.
And there are <eob> endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything # can take forever. <eol>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, they would <eob> have to improve <eob> their time to market <eob> by <eob> drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> to go and have a look at companies <eob> xxxx seem to # be more innovative, xxxx # Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how we were walking <eol> the <eol> halls at one these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> a management consultant <eol> and team of # bankers. <eob>
We felt like xxxxxxxxx in a <eol> land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies and <eob> lots of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eob> "How your company organized?" <eob> And <eol> we expected to xxx an org chart. <eol>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, <eol> "How many xxxxxx <eol> are working for <eob> you?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eol> "It depends". <eol>
You can imagine our surprise.
xx were for what we thought <eol> were some of the <eob> basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, the course of that day, we <eol> gained a better understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eob> and IT engineers in <eob> the same team <eol> so they could design, build <eob> and test ideas with customers <eol> independently of others in the company. <eob>
did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eol> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of that <eol> we had a session to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started xx like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how to apply some of these ideas to a bank.
But then, one of the hosts, a guy who had not <eol> said x xxxx all day, <eol> he <eol> suddenly said, <eol> "So I you like # our model. <eob>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are willing <eob> to give up?" What were we # willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, we knew he was right.
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up xx some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, over xxx past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies all over the world <eob> to change their ways of working. <eol>
xxx <eob> clearly, <eob> every company <eob> has their own skeptics <eol> about why is <eob> not <eol> going to work for <eob> them. <eob>
xxxx # product <eob> is more <eol> or "They don't have <eol> xxx legacy IT like we do," <eob> or <eob> "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry".
But for this # bank and also for the other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change # was possible. <eol>
Within a year, xx completely <eob> xxxx up <eol> the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eob> product, channels and <eob> # IT. <eol>
Three # thousand employees were xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
xx <eob> instead of product people <eob> sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eol> a product person and # an engineer xxxx now members of the same team.
You could be member of a team <eob> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the <eob> go-live date <eol> of that new organization, <eol> some were shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eob> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 years. <eob>
You <eob> would # hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing answers". (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eob> together <eob> every # day. <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get from xxx engineer <eob> who sitting right next to him.
They can decide to test with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting <eob> there xx not easy.
as it xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you <eol> willing to give up?" <eol> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead <eol> of decisions going <eol> up and <eob> down the organization, <eob> want the xxxx to
But <eob> to do so, we need all the skills <eol> expertise for that decision in the team. <eob>
this brings difficult <eol> trade-offs.
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different <eol> # countries today? <eob>
Or should we # invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eol>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way <eob> we do things <eob> across these teams? <eob>
We still need some kind <eol> xx management matrix.
Now, all these changes xx <eob> structure <eob> and and # -- <eob> they <eob> are <eol> not <eob> easy.
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to <eol> change <eob> is our own xxxxxxxxx
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams to be xxxxx <eob> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> xxxx have to <eol> be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders <eol> xxxxxxxxxx their people what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers.
But xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> that <eol> each employee <eol> needs to xxxxxx a leader, <eol> regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's about of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, # also cannot # <eob> to have all these xxxxx <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because that would <eol> certainly lead chaos. <eob>
xx # we need alignment and # autonomy at the same time, <eol> just like flock of birds.
In an organizational setting, this requires <eol> new behaviors, <eob> and with # each new behavior, <eob> there <eol> is up <eob> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure that everyone the organization <eob> is <eob> aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what.
But then they have to let go <eol> and # trust their teams to xxxx <eob> xxx right decisions on how to <eob> get there. <eol>
Now, creating alignment requires open and transparent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But you know how say <eol> that is a source of power?
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eob> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these <eol> companies, <eob> the <eol> teams typically work in sprints, and <eob> at the end of every <eob> sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eol>
And every day, <eol> each # member of the team <eol> gives an update of what they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore.
Everything do is for everyone.
xxx alignment is not easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eol> is not so obvious, either.
One executive at xxxxxxx company <eob> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
Now, <eol> today, to know how things are going, <eol> instead of looking at status reports, <eol> he needs to walk down xx the team floors <eol> to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx
And instead of telling people what do, he looks for ways # to help them.
That <eob> is radical change <eol> for <eob> xxxxxxx who used <eob> to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
Now I have # much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct <eob> much earlier if needed". <eob>
And middle managers <eob> need to change as # well. <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eol> for xxxxxx managers. <eob>
And in the old world, there was xxxx <eol> idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just xxxxxx <eob> orders. <eol>
But now, instead of only managing other people, <eol> middle managers were <eol> xx become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, the last years, <eob> you have just been telling <eol> other people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eol>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eol> and some great people # leave the company.
the result is a new culture with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all xx this is hard work. <eob>
But # it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used <eol> to deploying new product features a few times per <eob>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eol> and # xxxxxxx the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eol> the whole organization <eol> becomes more <eol> efficient. <eob>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy.
It feels as if # walking <eob> the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up. <eol>
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they <eob> cannot claim victory
But at least with this xxx # model, <eol> they are # much xxxxxx prepared <eol> to respond # to change.
The world is getting faster <eob> and more complex, <eob> so we <eob> need to reboot our way of working. <eol>
And the hardest <eol> part of <eol> that change is xxx xx structure <eob> or or procedure, and it's also not just <eol> senior executives taking charge. <eol>
Leaders will be all of those <eol> in the # organization who embrace the change.
We all have to lead <eob> the change.
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up?
Thank <eob> you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>

[The Way We Work] My name is # Dan, I'm a <eob> partner <eob> at <eob> # a global creative consultancy.
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I xxxxxxx on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought my double life, <eol> I couldn't help but xxxxxx ... <eob>
When your xxxx self <eol> is a little nontraditional, how <eob> much of it can you really <eol> bring to xxx <eob>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, I thought there # <eol> one way to be x leader: <eob> decisive <eob> and serious. <eob>
But not me. <eob>
So I'd put on basically <eol> office drag to fit the <eob> role: I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in my hand motions. <eob>
someone who gets <eob> really excited <eol> about things, <eob> so I'd temper that.
x had this little voice in my # head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eol>
I had xxx well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eol> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's <eob>
But you don't need to <eob> beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: <eob> me in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, thinking friends <eob> would get a kick out of it. <eol>
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went viral, <eob> and at first # it was pure # fun.
I started these incredible <eol> messages from <eob> people <eob> about happy it made them, how it encouraged them <eob> to be their authentic selves. <eol>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the <eob> time to <eol> tell that <eol> little voice in my head to <eol> just xxxx up <eol> and let xxxxxx be me. <eol>
But then things got a little too big.
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eol> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eol> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eob> still <eob> respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eol> I thought was # <eob> going to have to <eol> get a different job. <eol>
But something happened, <eol> something small. <eol>
I got a text from my <eol> boss, <eol> it wasn't long, <eob> it just said, "Wow, xxxxxxx <eob> With a link to an article that had just gone <eob> up about me. <eob>
And it let me put that little, <eol> scared voice away and just # be excited <eol> about this whole new world, <eol> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one xxxxxxx <eol> sometimes all it takes one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my <eol> coworkers <eob> started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, more playful with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eol> them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as <eol> # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eol> would actually decrease my standing with my team. <eol>
But xxxx done the opposite. <eol>
Two years in, I never imagined that <eol> this <eol> part of me # not just be <eol> embraced, <eob> but could actually <eol> help my career.
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, in an office xxxxx creativity valued <eob> and I xxx already pretty established in my when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe <eob> it isn't. <eob>
all of this has <eob> taught me so much <eob> about just importance of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to <eob> work. <eob>
And <eob> it's really <eob> challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eob> about what it takes be xxxxxxxxxxx
There's no one kind of # way to be a leader.
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eol>
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect # mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eob> "Gosh, that xxx frustrating". <eob>
We can talk about challenges <eol> and <eol> struggles in an way, than everybody pretending that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eol>
Think of <eob> all the wasted <eol> energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different.
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, <eol> is that in this big study of <eol> covering, 93 percent of those <eob> who say <eob> they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eol>
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> xxx all <eob> of our strange <eob> inner voices <eob> have a long way # to go on acceptance. <eol>
There's a big xxxxxxxxxx <eol> between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a little late. <eob>
Personally, I'm taking # all this <eol> as a call # to be <eob> the # ally <eob> who, like my # boss did for me, <eob> lets # people know <eol> that it's xx to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> have x disability or are <eol> deeply religious, see <eol> what it's like <eob> being your full self # at work. <eob>
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eob>
The basic problem <eol> with xxxxxxx in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eob> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

Some of them choose not even <eol> to <eol> have a xxxx base, nomads. <eol>
Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eob> they are new places <eol> every day, week or month.
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> don't care xxxxx they are.
Our focus <eob> on distributed <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> the very beginning. <eob>
I don't use the word "remote," <eol> because it <eob> sets up expectation, that some people are essential and # some aren't. <eol>
I use the word "distributed" <eob> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eob> on an # equal playing field.
I <eol> think a distributed workforce <eol> is the most effective way <eob> to <eob> build a company. <eol>
The # key is # you have to <eol> approach # it consciously.
When we started WordPress, <eol> many of the first 20 hires <eob> were people I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd collaborated online, <eob> sometimes for years. <eol>
wanted to continue that for one simple reason. <eob>
I <eob> believe that <eob> talent intelligence <eob> are equally distributed throughout # the world. <eob> But opportunity <eol> is not.
In Valley, <eol> the big # tech companies fish xxxx essentially the <eob> same small pond or bay.
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives <eol> in California, you can gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes xx and goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in the world. <eol> They bring a <eob> different understanding of that culture <eob> and a different lived <eol> experience. <eol>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go <eob> there's a desire to give # people autonomy <eob> over how they do their work.
Unless xxxxxx in a role <eol> where # specific hours are important, you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, their windows, the food they want <eol> to eat, you can <eob> # choose when there's music and when there's <eob>
You xxx choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You # can save the time you'd spend commuting <eol> and put it into <eol> that are important to you.
A distributed workforce is # <eol> ideal for a technology company. <eob>
people often ask me, <eol> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eob> you can do a few things to build distributed xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
First: document everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the moment, <eol> in the kitchen, in the hall. <eob>
if people work <eob> and some members of the team <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why.
Always leave x trail of you were <eol> and what you were thinking # <eob> about. <eob>
This allows others <eob> to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different time zones to <eob> it's also <eol> great <eob> to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, people leaving and people joining. <eol>
Try # to # have as much <eol> communication <eol> as xxxxxxxx online. <eol>
everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new to catch up quickly.
You also need to find the right tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eob> that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, <eob> video conferencing, project <eob> management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # that changed how <eob> probably aren't objects anymore.
They're things you access <eob> through your computer. <eol>
So experiment with different tools that enable <eob> see what works.
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a office, <eob> you're in the same place 48 weeks <eob> out of the year <eob> and <eol> you might have three four <eob> weeks apart. <eob>
We xxx to # that: we come together <eob> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a # year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the <eob> entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal # is connecting people. We want to make <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eol> and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work together <eol> the rest of the year, they # can bring together that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility <eob> to <eob> make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that <eol> they can put <eol> towards a co-working <eob> xxxxx or just to # buy coffee, so don't get <eob> xxxxxx out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eob> decided to pool <eob> their stipends together <eob> and rented a <eol> workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the <eob> company <eob> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is <eol> money <eol> they can xxxxxx <eol> in getting the right monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for xxxxx <eob>
Today, there are xxxx a few <eol> companies that <eob> are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict that 90 percent companies that are to be changing <eob> the course of the world going xx function this <eob> # way.
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you think about <eob> what you're going to <eol> build next, <eol> how you can tap <eob> into global talent, <eob> xxxx people autonomy to live and work <eol> where # they feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully in whatever is that you're creating together.
