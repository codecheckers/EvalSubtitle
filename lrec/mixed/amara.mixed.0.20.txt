Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eol> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to the world <eol> of cyberharassment.
The kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan is the sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eol> with 140 <eob> million people having access <eol> to mobile technologies, and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the rise of new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their bodies; <eob> where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called "family honor"; <eob> where women are left <eob> to die <eol> right outside their houses <eob> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a very small village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eol> didn't allow their women <eob> to pursue their <eol> higher education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of disapproval. <eob>
But in the end, I knew <eol> it's either me or them, <eol> and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eol> phone until I was married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eob> this tool became a tool <eol> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eob> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eob> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our Constitution?
While the law states that a woman <eol> has the same equal access <eob> to the information, <eob> why is it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to take a step, <eob> instead of keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I founded the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues <eol> and women's experiences in online spaces <eol> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women <eob> that access to the safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the questions <eob> that have bothered me all these years.
With a hope in my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's <eob> and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the women <eol> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they face serious threats online. <eob>
I think of the women who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go about their daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the internet <eol> is an access to knowledge, and knowledge is freedom.
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
Why? <eob>
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, <eob> they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has to stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eol> to choose the right course? <eol>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For <eob> years, I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to share with you <eob> what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eob> how and why <eob> they <eol> set meaningful and <eob> audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.
Let's go back to 1975. <eob>
Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn, <eol> I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest manager <eol> of his or any other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you know. <eob>
Execution is what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and <eob> Key Results". <eob>
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management by objective systems <eob> are the objectives and the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can look <eob> and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I do that, or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work for teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eol>
The objectives are what <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's the truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their numbers, <eob> but they lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their <eob> teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the <eob> right way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eol> combine their ambitions <eol> to their passion <eob> and to their purpose, <eob> and they develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna is a health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they used data to serve the health needs of lots of workers at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, <eob> the federal government issued a proposal <eob> to <eob> build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our poor, our children <eob> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 <eob> people <eob> and this database <eob> had to be built in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> that they had to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch.
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why.
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, <eob> he had his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the country <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from bankruptcy, <eob> and today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for millions of others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> to <eob> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to <eol> have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, <eob> they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eob> would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and his ONE <eob> organization <eol> has focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> lead you to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained inside it. <eol>
It gives us an environment for risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing is not a fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eob> magic is around the corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the <eol> whys, <eob> with Bono the whats <eob> of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, the hows are the key results. That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eol>
They're aggressive <eob> but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In <eol> 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eol>
Here they are, <eob> 24 <eob> years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not quite. <eob>
What he really said was, <eob> "We don't have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> her objectives and her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're used for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's to get collective commitment <eol> to <eob> truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> for <eob> the future of web applications -- <eob> in other words, build the best browser. <eob>
He was very thoughtful <eol> about how he chose his key results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had this one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eol> numbers of users, <eob> but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal was 20 million users and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third year, <eob> he upped the ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, <eob> and kaboom!
He got 111 million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this story, <eob> not so much <eol> for the happy ending, <eol> but it shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why <eol> that we pour into those vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those fundamentals are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eol> you can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we <eob> think of the world-changing goals <eol> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eob> affordable health care, high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered today by OKRs.
Now, I've been called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading <eob> the good gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that really matters, <eob> because we can take OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform those informations. <eob>
We can get back on the right track <eob> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eol>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What is history? <eob>
It is something written <eob> by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many <eob> countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or determined by the leaders, <eob> and common people could not <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever will be a truly democratic nation, <eob> and this is due <eob> to the way <eol> history has been framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I asked myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eol>
So last year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible <eol> real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or application <eob> can follow a news feed <eol> for each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eol> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like you and me, <eob> not demigods, <eol> and we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eol> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eob> who used to think that our country has always been <eob> an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eol> was not our destiny. <eob>
But if we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we see that Russia <eol> could have had a different history <eob> and a democratic future, <eol> as any other country could or still <eol> can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or one of the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can help us create a better future, <eob> because history is just a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, <eob> we started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary series <eol> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> a <eol> year marked by global social change <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now. <eob>
But we are making that history alive <eob> by imagining what if all the main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a lot of individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or <eob> in France or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people in power <eol> are not the only ones making choices. <eob>
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eob>
We all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using human-like intelligence.
And this intelligence of computers <eol> is often referred to as AI <eob> or <eol> artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eob> in <eob> detecting and diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of patients every year <eob> lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our best way to help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eol> and can <eob> artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> an expert physician first orders <eol> very expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies <eol> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the patient. <eob>
As <eob> you can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is not considered practical for the developing world. <eob>
And in fact, in many <eob> industrialized nations, as well. <eol>
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using artificial intelligence? <eol>
Today, if I <eob> were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order <eob> of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then go <eol> to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze those images for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, <eol> I can train a standard deep <eol> neural network <eol> or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we invent more scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eob> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures to solve some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eol>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eol> instead of starting <eol> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These information packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eol>
In a sense, we converted one image <eol> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for training. <eob>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> or a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from the medical image onto this image, <eob> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image. <eob>
Much to our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only 50 -- <eob> of these composite images to train <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eob> we can now train the AI algorithms <eol> in an unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, white light <eol> photographs from the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that we are poised <eol> to enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make an incredible <eol> impact <eob> on our <eob> future. <eob>
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we should also continue thinking about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just like getting over a cold, <eob> you could heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, if we have <eol> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to <eob> give us <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out <eob> of nowhere might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eob> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and <eob> even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass.
To make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through <eol> instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From <eob> a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection, <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eob> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eob> that are currently being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eob> an injured muscle <eob> with these materials, <eob> there was a large number of immune cells <eob> in that material <eol> and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
So in this case, <eob> instead of the immune cells rushing off <eob> towards infection to fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T cell, <eob> was present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eol> and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil <eob> and try and tape it back together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but it might not be in the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong.
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back <eol> without these scars <eob> and look like what it was before we were even injured.
I'm working to create materials that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that any time <eol> a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers are using <eob> to try and build new tissue. <eob>
So when I place that material, <eol> or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system creates <eol> a small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the <eob> way <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> affects our daily activities, <eob> like going for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eob> from plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more or less porous, <eob> gels of different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that <eob> can be changed for different tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of signals <eob> that mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going <eol> to wake up tomorrow <eol> and be able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune system <eol> to help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would <eol> dash across the floor <eob> and stick my face in front of <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eob> comfortable for one more day. <eob>
These kinds of <eol> dangerous <eol> incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the US, the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eol> can spend 20, even 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy becomes a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to get her flu medicine, or do you feed her? <eol>
Or do you <eol> keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger and systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with <eob> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have the tools to address <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eol>
However, even as we approach cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar earn much more than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, <eob> utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable <eob> access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eol> of local communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eob>
So we start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eol> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eob> to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eob> to community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation programs <eol> to help families bring down <eol> their energy bills. <eol>
We're even working directly <eol> with <eol> elected officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of energy equity and resilience succeed, we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but they're only able to help <eol> a fraction of those in need.
In fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is <eol> not sustainable. <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy <eol> efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eol> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make ends meet. <eob>
This is life-changing. <eob>
This <eob> is an opportunity <eol> for families to use their energy savings to sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eol> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about them. <eob>
There are millions nationwide having <eob> to make the same impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eol> to make autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eol> with any one of us? <eob>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eob> that <eol> takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eol>
But the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we <eol> willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was working with a bank <eol> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more <eol> relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen a bank from the inside, so let me try to illustrate <eol> what many traditional banks look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to go <eol> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with 20 people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
Getting anything done can take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have to improve <eob> their time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as <eol> well.
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> to go and have a look at companies <eob> that seem to be more innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how we were walking <eol> the halls at one <eob> of these companies <eob> in <eob> December 2014, <eob> a management consultant <eol> and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt like strangers in a strange land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to explain how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, "How many people <eol> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for <eob> what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and their answer was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, over the course of that <eob> day, <eol> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of others in the company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eol> right there in the team. <eol>
Now, at the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eob> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started to like their model, <eol> so we were already thinking of how <eob> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all <eob> day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see you like our model. <eob>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are you willing to give <eol> up?" <eol> What were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eol> it's about giving up <eol> on some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their ways of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company has their own skeptics <eob> about why this is not <eol> going to work for them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," or "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT <eob> like we do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for this bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I have <eob> worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we completely <eol> blew up the old silos <eol> between marketing, <eol> product, channels and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees were reorganized <eol> into 350 <eol> multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So instead of product people sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a product person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same team. <eob>
You could be a member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date of that new organization, <eob> some people were shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eob> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they <eob> were sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing for answers". (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're having coffee together every day. <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eol> who is sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting there is not easy. <eob>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going up and down the organization, <eob> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to do so, we need all the skills <eol> and expertise for that decision <eob> in the team.
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eob> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do things <eob> across these teams? <eob>
We still need some kind <eob> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes to structure <eol> and process and procedure -- <eob> they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eol> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when to do, <eol> how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers.
But it also means that each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eob> to take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all these teams running in different directions, <eol> because that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment and autonomy <eob> at the same time, <eob> just like a flock of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eol> and with each new behavior, <eob> there is giving up <eol> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> that everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go <eol> and trust their teams <eob> to make the right decisions <eob> on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you know how they say <eol> that information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share the output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eob> each member of the team gives an update <eob> of what they are working on <eob> individually.
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be <eol> uncomfortable for people, <eob> because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, alignment is not <eol> easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain how he used to be <eob> a master <eob> of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down to the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is radical change <eob> for someone who used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more <eob> transparency, <eob> and I <eol> can course-correct <eob> much earlier if needed". <eol>
And middle managers <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the old <eob> world, there was <eob> this idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eol> to become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been telling other people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, and some great people leave the company. <eob>
But the result is a new culture with <eob> less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per year. <eob>
Now they have releases every few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient.
And finally, if you walk the halls of these companies today, <eol> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the halls of a very large start-up. <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory yet.
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eob> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is not in structure <eob> or process or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eol> senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be <eol> all of those <eol> in the organization <eob> who embrace the change.
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A leader is steady, firm, <eol> decisive, unwavering. <eob>
Never let 'em see you sweat, <eol> always <eob> have an answer. <eob>
[The Way We Work] <eob> My <eob> name is Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's another side to me: <eol> Carrie Dragshaw, <eol> the character I created on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought about my double life, <eol> I couldn't help but wonder ... <eob>
When your true self <eol> is a little nontraditional, how much of it can you really <eol> bring to the office?
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eob> I thought there was <eol> one way to be a leader: <eob> decisive and serious. <eob>
But that's not me. <eob>
So I'd put on basically <eol> office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in my hand motions. <eob>
I'm someone who gets <eol> really excited about things, so I'd temper that. <eob>
I had this little voice <eol> in my head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had one well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's great. <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I dressed up as my favorite <eob> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eob> thinking my friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first it was pure fun. <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about how happy it made them, <eob> how it encouraged them <eol> to be their <eob> authentic selves. <eol>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell that <eol> little voice in my head to just shut up <eob> and let myself be me. <eob>
But then things got a little too big. <eob>
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere -- <eob> In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eol> and I got terrified: <eob> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eol> I thought I was going to have to <eol> get a different job. <eob>
But then, something happened, <eob> something small. <eob>
I got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With <eob> a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eob>
And it let me put that little, <eol> scared voice away <eob> and just be excited about this whole new world, <eol> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one person, <eob> sometimes all it takes is one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently.
They became more open, <eol> more playful <eob> with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me gave them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my <eob> standing with my team. <eob>
But it's done the opposite. <eob>
Two years in, <eob> I never could have imagined that this <eol> part of me would not just be embraced, <eob> but could actually help my career. <eob>
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New <eob> York City, <eob> in an office where creativity is valued <eob> and I was already pretty established <eol> in my career when all of this <eob> started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe it <eob> isn't. <eob>
But all of this has taught me so much <eob> about just the importance <eol> of bringing your whole self to work. <eob>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eob> about what it takes to be successful. <eob>
There's no one kind of way to be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding your strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect leader mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eol> "Gosh, that was frustrating". <eol>
We can talk about challenges <eol> and struggles in an open way, <eob> rather than everybody pretending <eol> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eol> wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to me, though, <eol> is that in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eol>
So clearly, our workplaces and all of our strange inner voices <eob> have a long way to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big difference between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a little late. <eob>
Personally, I'm taking all of this <eol> as a call to be the ally <eob> who, like my boss did for me, <eob> lets people know that it's OK to open up. <eol>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> or have a disability <eol> or are deeply religious, <eob> see what it's like <eol> being your <eol> full self at work. <eob>
You might <eol> be pleasantly surprised.
The basic problem <eol> with working in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work environment. <eol>

Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eob>
Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a home base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eob> they are in new places every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> from the very beginning. <eol>
Notice I don't use the word "remote," because it sets up the <eob> expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to build a <eol> company. <eob>
The key is you have to <eol> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many of the first 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I wanted to continue <eol> that <eol> for one simple reason.
I believe that talent and intelligence are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the <eob> big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the same small pond or bay. <eol>
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eob> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a role where specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eol> their windows, the food <eob> they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music and when <eol> there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed workforce <eol> is ideal for a technology company. <eob>
But people often ask me, <eob> "This works great for y'all, <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eol> you can do a few things <eol> to build distributed capability. <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the <eob> moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the hall. <eob>
But if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without <eob> understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eol> and what you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eob> people leaving and people <eol> joining. <eob>
Try to have as much communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new people to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how you work <eol> probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eol> you're in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out of the year <eob> and you might have three or four weeks apart. <eob>
We try to flip that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eob>
It's <eob> half-work, half-play. <eob>
The <eob> primary goal is connecting people. <eob> We want to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eol> and they have a deeper connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring together <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final practice: <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eol> or just to buy coffee, so they don't <eol> get kicked out of the coffee <eol> shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together <eol> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the <eob> company gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they can invest <eol> in getting the right chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or two, <eol> I predict that 90 percent of companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eol> the course of the world <eob> are <eob> going to function this way.
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eob> give people autonomy to live and work <eol> where they feel they should and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eob>
