Imagine waking up to # a stranger xx sometimes multiple strangers # -- questioning your right <eob> to <eob> for something that # you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an <eol> # <eol> scared # and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment.
The kind of # harassment that <eob> women <eol> xxxx in # xxxxxxxx is very # serious <eob> and leads sometimes xxxxxx outcomes.
This kind # of xxxxxxxxxx women accessing # xxx internet # -- essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a <eob> form of # oppression. <eob>
Pakistan <eob> xx the sixth most populous <eol> xxxxxxx in the world, with 140 million people having access <eob> to mobile technologies, and 15 # percent penetration.
And this number doesn't to go xxxx <eol> with the # rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is <eob> also xxx birthplace # xxx # youngest # Nobel Peace Prize <eol> winner, <eob> Malala # <eob>
# that's just <eob> one aspect of <eob> Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect is where <eob> the twisted concept of honor is # linked xx # women # their bodies; where <eol> men are allowed to disrespect # women and # even # kill <eob> them sometimes in the <eob> name of so-called # <eol> "family honor"; <eob> where women are xxxx to die right outside their # <eob> houses for speaking to # x man # on a mobile <eob> phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor".
Let me xxx this <eob> very clearly: <eol> it's # not # honor; it's cold-blooded <eol>
I come from <eol> a # very small village <eol> in Punjab, # Pakistan, <eob> where are not # allowed <eol> pursue their higher education. <eol>
The elders # of my extended <eob> didn't allow their women <eol> to pursue xxxxxx education or professional careers. <eol>
However, unlike the # other <eol> male guardians of # my family, <eol> my father one xxx really <eob> my ambitions. <eol>
To get my law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] xxxxxx of disapproval. <eob>
But # in the end, I knew <eol> it's xxxxxx me or them, and <eob> I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My family's traditions and <eob> expectations for a woman <eol> # allow # me <eob> xx own a mobile <eol> phone until x was married.
And # xxxx when x # married, <eol> tool became a for my # surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted idea <eol> of being surveilled my <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eob> xxx threw out of xxx house, along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And was the time <eol> xxxx I first xxxxx myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed to # enjoy # the xxxxx rights <eol> enshrined in our Constitution? <eol>
While the law that a woman <eol> has the same equal access <eob> xx the information, <eob> why is # always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers # and husbands xx <eol> # xxx granting these rights # to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the # law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I <eob> to take <eob> a # step, instead of xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> these patriarchal <eob> and societal <eob>
I founded the xxxxxxx Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the # issues <eol> and women's # in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eol>
xxxx lobbying # free and safe <eol> internet to convincing young # women <eob> that xxxxxx to xxx safe internet <eol> is their <eob> fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to my part in igniting the spark <eob> xx address xxx questions <eol> that xxxx bothered me xxx these years. <eob>
With a hope <eol> in xx <eol> and to offer a solution to menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the <eob> region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 xx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx extend <eob> my # support # to xxx women xxx not xxxx who # xx turn to face xxxxxxx # threats # online. <eol>
I think # xx the xxx do # xxx have the <eol> necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma xxxx feel unsafe in online xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they xx about xxxxx activities, thinking # <eol> that there is x rape # threat their in-box.

We're at a xxxxxxxx # moment. <eob>
xxxxxxxx <eol> xx our # xxxxx institutions are failing us. <eob>
Why? <eob>
In some # cases, because they're <eob> or <eob> but often, they've <eol> taken <eol> to the objectives. <eol>
And this is # <eol>
This has to # <eol>
How are we going to # correct these wrongs? <eol>
How # we <eol> xx choose <eob> xxx right course? <eob>
xxxx not xxxxx <eol> to easy. <eob>
xxx # I've with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen # the right objectives <eol> and # the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> xxxxxx of them failed.
And xxxxx I'm <eob> # to share with what really makes a difference <eol> -- <eob> that's xxxxxx crucial, <eob> how and why <eol> they # set meaningful and xxxxxx <eob> the xxxxx xxxxx the <eol>
Let's go # <eob> back # xxxxx <eol>
Yep, xxxx is <eol> me.
I've a lot to learn, xxx a computer # engineer, <eol> I've # got long <eol> hair, but I'm # working under Andy xxxxxx <eol> who's been xxxxxx the greatest manager <eol> of # his or # any other <eob>
Andy a superb # leader and also a teacher, <eob> he said to # xxx # "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter <eol> what xxx know. <eob>
is # <eob> what matters # <eob> the most". <eob>
And # xx # <eob> invented a system <eol> called "Objectives # and # <eob>
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't <eol> it? <eol>
xxxx xxxxx excellent execution.
So x xxxxxxx video from the 1970s <eol> of professor Andy Grove.
(Video) Andy <eob> Grove: # The two key phrases <eob> of the xxxxxxxxxx by objective systems <eob> xxx the objectives the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective xx xxx <eob>
The key <eol> results have xx xxxxxxxxx but at # xxx end you xxx look <eol> xxx without # any argument say, "Did # I that, or did I # do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
Objectives and Key Results, or # OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> they work for teams, <eol> they # <eob> even work for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what you # to have # accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
and how. <eol>
But here's <eol> many of us are setting goals wrong, most xx us are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A # lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and meet them. <eol>
They ship their sales, <eob> they introduce their new products, they make their <eob> but they lack a <eob> xxxxx of <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> to inspire teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eob> xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, # <eob> you must xxxxxx the question, "Why?" <eob>
Because combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their passion and to <eol> purpose, and # develop a # clear <eob> and compelling sense of <eol>
I want tell # a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable <eob>
Her name xx xxxx Kim. <eol>
She runs a company xxxxxx Nuna. <eob>
# is health xxxx data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was # founded, <eol> they used data to serve health needs <eol> of lots of workers at large companies. <eol>
And # xxxx two # years <eol> into the company's xxxxx <eob> the xxxxxxx issued a <eol> build the xxxxx ever <eob> cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll xxxxxxxx <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people # with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time # <eob> was <eol> just 15 # people <eob> and database <eol> had to xx # built in one # year, <eob> and they a whole <eob> set of <eol> that they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, weren't going to make <eol> very much money on # project. <eob>
This xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx moment, <eob> and Jini # seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She <eob> not flinch. <eol>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal <eob>
xxxxxx younger brother Kimong <eob> has autism. <eob>
And when # he was seven, xx # had # his first grand <eob> mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to xxx ground. <eob> He stopped breathing. <eol>
Jini's parents are immigrants. <eol>
They # came to the <eol> with limited resources <eol> speaking little xxxxxxxx so it was up to Jini enroll her family in Medicaid. <eol>
She was xxxx years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became <eob> her company, and xxxx company bid on, <eob> # <eol> and delivered on # that contract. <eol>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini # Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved xx xxxxxx from # bankruptcy, and today it xxxxxxxx # for Kimong's health <eol> and # millions of others. <eob>
Nuna # xx xx xxxx # letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life whose <eob> story <eol> deserves <eol> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story xx <eob> that # a xxxxxxxxxx sense <eob> of <eol> why xxx <eob> # be for <eob> our
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And xxxxxxxxxx are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and <eol> they're a kind of <eob> vaccine against xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You xxxxx a <eob> be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key but # for years, Bono # has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty # <eol> and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has on two really <eol> gorgeous, <eol> objectives.
The first is debt relief <eob> for <eob> xxx # poorest countries in the <eob> world. <eob>
The <eob> next is xxxxxxxxx access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, # why are these # good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back xxx <eob>
Significant? Check. xxxxxxxxx # Yes. <eob>
Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxx So you're passionate?
How # passionate?
What actions does your # passion <eob> lead xxx <eob>
If the # heart doesn't xxxx <eol> a <eol> perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then # <eob> xxxx passion means nothing.
OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry xxxxxxxxx inside # it.
It gives us # an environment for risk, <eob> where xxxxxxx is not a offense.
And when that sort <eob> of structure and environment <eob> and the right xxxxxxx <eob> magic is around # the xxxxxxx <eol>
JD: I love that. <eob>
xxxx the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the <eob> corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
with Jini covered the <eob> Bono the whats of goal-setting.
turn our attention xx the hows.
the the xxx results. <eob> we meet our # objectives. <eol>
And good results <eol> specific <eob>
They're aggressive realistic.
xxxxxxx # measurable, <eob> they're <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to xxxxxxxx cofounders, <eol> Larry and Sergey. <eol>
Here they <eob> xxxx <eol> 24 xxxxx old in their garage. <eob>
And xxxxxx enthusiastically said he'd adopt # them. <eol>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
xxxx # he really # said was, <eob> "We don't # have # any other xxx <eol> to this xxxxxxxx <eob> so <eob> we'll # it a go". (Laughter) <eob>
And # x took xxxx # as a kind of endorsement.
But <eob> every quarter since # then, <eol> every Googler has xxxxxxx <eob> her objectives and key results. <eob>
They've # graded them, <eol> and # they've published <eol> everyone to see. <eob>
And <eob> these are not <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set <eob> xxxxxx <eob>
They're used x higher purpose, <eob> xxx to xxx # collective # xxxxxxxxxx to truly # stretch <eob> goals. <eol>
In 2008, a # Googler, xxxxxx <eob> Pichai, <eob> took # on xx <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob> which was to <eol> the # next generation xxxxxx platform <eob> for # the # future xx web applications -- <eol> # words, build the best browser.
xx was # thoughtful <eol> how # he chose key results. <eob>
How measure the best browser? <eol>
It be ad # xx engagement. <eob>
xxx He said: numbers users, <eob> because users are # <eob> going decide <eob> if Chrome is a great <eob> browser or not. <eol>
So he had <eob> one <eob> three-year-long objective: xxxxx the xxxx # browser. <eob>
And then <eob> every <eob> he stuck to the same key results, numbers of users, but he upped xxx ante. <eob>
xx # the first year, <eob> his was 20 million users <eol> he xxxxxx it. <eob>
He # less 10.
Second year, he # raised <eob> the bar to million. <eob>
xx got to 37 million users.
Somewhat better. <eol>
In # the third year, <eob> he upped xxx ante xxxx more to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 xxxxxxx users.
why # <eob> I like this story, <eob> so much for the # ending, <eob> it xxxxx # <eob> choosing the right objective and then xxxxxxxx to year after year after year. <eol>
It's a xxxxxxx story for a # xxxx like me. <eol>
Now, I think xx OKRs <eob> as vessels <eob> that are <eob> made from the <eol> whats hows of <eol> # ambitions. <eol>
What really matters is the why that we # pour into those vessels.
That's why we # do our work.

What is # history?
It is something # <eob> written by the winners.
xxxxx is <eob> # stereotype that <eob> # history should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or <eob>
As a # result, people many like # Russia, <eob> xxxx at history as something <eol> that # was predetermined <eob> xx determined # by the xxxxxxxx <eol> and common people could # not <eob> in any # way.
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eob> that Russia could ever <eob> have been <eob> or ever be a democratic nation, <eob> and this is to the way <eol> has been framed <eol> to the xxxxxxxx of Russia. <eob>
And this <eob> xx not true. <eol>
xx prove it, <eol> I spent two years <eol> my xxxx trying to go 100 years back, <eob> # the year # <eob> the of the Revolution. <eob>
I # asked # myself, if the <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx # 100 years ago? <eob>
So # last year, <eol> we xxxxx <eob> a <eob> network for <eob> dead <eol> named Project1917.com. <eol>
My team and <eol> x created <eob> our # software, digitized and uploaded xxx possible real diaries and letters <eol> xxxxxxx # more people years ago. <eob>
So any xx our website xx application <eob> can follow # a news feed <eol> for each day of # xxxx xxxx what people <eol> like <eol> Stravinsky or Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx thought # and xxxxx <eol>
We watch all <eol> those xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> # ordinary people like you and # me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see xxxx history consists <eol> of their mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project was a xxxxx for xxxx Russians, <eob> who used to xxxxx that our country <eol> has always # been an autocratic empire <eob> and xxx ideas <eol> of freedom democracy <eol> could # never have # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> just # democracy <eob> xxx not our # destiny. <eol>
But if take x broader look, <eol> it's not that xxxxx and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 # led to # 70 xxxxx of communist dictatorship. <eol>
But with this xxxxxxxx we # # that Russia could xxx a different history <eob> and a democratic future, <eol> xx any <eol> xxxxx country could # still can. <eob>
Reading # the xxxxx from xxxxx you xxxxx that xxxxxx <eob> was xxx first country # <eob> xx the # xxxxx abolish # the death # xxxxxxxx <eol> or one of first ones <eol> to grant # women voting xxxxxxx
Knowing history and <eol> understanding <eob> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can us create a better # future, because just a xxxxxxxxx <eol> of # what's happening right xxxx <eob>
We do need new # ways of # telling and year, example, we a new project <eol> that is # <eob> called <eob> 1968Digital.com, <eob> and is series <eob> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, # 1968, <eol> year marked xx global social xxxxxx <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the xxxxx as we know now.
xxx we <eob> # are making <eol> that history # alive <eob> by imagining xxxx if all main <eob> characters could use mobile phones ... just like that? <eob>
And we <eol> # see that a lot of individuals were facing # the same challenges <eol> and # were fighting for the same # values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> # or in or in France or xx China <eol> or Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eol> in such democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eol> we # show that people in power <eob> not the only xxxx xxxxxx # choices.
xxxx # gives xxx user possibility reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an xxxxxxx <eol>

Computer algorithms # today <eob> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a xxxxxxx scale, <eol> using human-like
And this intelligence xx xxxxxxxxx is often to as AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eol>
AI is # poised to make an incredible impact on our lives # xx the future. <eol>
Today, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several illnesses, <eol> xxxx as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands xx patients every year <eob> lose their lives <eol> due to liver and <eob> oral
best way to help these patients <eol> is to perform xxxxx detection and # of these diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, <eol> can artificial intelligence help?
In patients who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert # physician xxxxx <eob> orders <eob> expensive <eob> medical imaging technologies such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # to # <eob> be performed. <eol>
those images are xxxxxxxxxx <eol> another xxxxxxxxx xxxx # <eob> diagnoses <eol> # <eob> images to the patient. <eob>
As you can xxxx # xxxx is a very # resource-intensive process, <eob> expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical # technologies, <eob> and # is not considered <eol> practical for the xxxxxxxxxx
And in xxxxx in xxxx industrialized # nations, as well. <eob>
So, we # solve this problem <eob> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # were # to use traditional <eob> artificial intelligence architectures to this problem, <eol> I would require # 10,000 <eol> -- <eob> I # repeat, on an order of xxxxxx <eob> of very expensive medical xxxxxx <eol> first to be generated. <eob>
After <eol> # xxxxx I would then # go <eob> to physician, <eob> who then # analyze <eob> those xxxxxx xxx me.
And using <eob> those two pieces of information, <eol> I # can train a standard # deep neural xxxxxxx <eol> or <eob> a xxxx learning network <eob> to xxxxxxx # patient's # <eob>
Similar # # xxx approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence # approaches xxxxxx from the same <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and expert medical <eob> technologies. <eob>
So, can xx invent # more effective <eob> and xxxx <eob> # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve xxxxx very <eol> problems facing xx today? <eob>
And is exactly <eol> what group xx MIT xxxxx does. <eol>
We have invented a variety of unorthodox architectures <eob> to solve some xx the # xxxx important <eol> challenges <eob> facing us today <eob> xx # medical imaging and # clinical xxxxxxx <eob>
In the example I <eol> with xxx today, we had two goals.
Our first was xx reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence # algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # reduce the # use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how did # we it?
# our xxxxx goal, instead starting <eob> with tens # and thousands <eol> of very # expensive # <eol> medical <eob> like # traditional AI, <eol> started with a single medical image. <eol>
this <eol> image, my team and I <eob> xxxxxxx out a very # clever <eob> way <eob> to <eol> extract billions <eob> of information packets.
These packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry and # rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eob>
xx a <eob> sense, we xxxxxxxxx one # image <eol> into # of data points, <eol> massively reducing the amount # # data <eob> needed xxxxxxxxx <eob>
For <eol> our second goal, <eob> xx reduce the use of expensive # medical imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> xx # with # x standard, <eob> # photograph, acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> x mobile xxx # the # patient.
Then remember xxxxx <eol> billions information # packets? <eol>
overlaid <eol> xxxxx <eob> xxxx <eob> the medical xxxxx <eob> onto this image, <eob> creating xxxxxxxxx <eob> that we a # composite xxxxxx <eob>
Much to our # surprise, <eol> we xxxx required # -- <eol> I repeat, 50 <eob> of composite xxxxxx to train our algorithms to high efficiencies.
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead <eob> of using <eol> 10,000 very expensive medical images, we can now the AI # <eol> an unorthodox way, <eol> using only of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile xxxxxxx <eob> and diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms accept, in the future xxxx right # now, <eob> some very simple, # xxxxx <eol> photographs from # the patient, # of xxxxxxxxx <eol> imaging technologies. <eob>
I xxxxxxx <eol> # that we are poised <eob> to enter an era xxxxx artificial intelligence is going to # make an <eol> impact on our future.
And I think that xxxxxxxx about traditional AI, <eob> which is application-poor, xx should also continue thinking <eob> unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence <eob> which # <eob> can accept small amounts of data xxx # some the most <eol> problems xxxxxx us today, <eob> especially # in <eol> health care.
xxxxx you <eob> very <eol>

What # if # you could take # a or vaccine and, just like # getting # over a <eob> xxxxx <eob> you could # heal your wounds # faster? <eob>
Today, if we have <eol> an operation or xx accident, <eob> we're in <eol> the hospital <eol> for # weeks, <eol> and often left <eol> with scars and # side <eob> effects of our inability xx regenerate <eol> or regrow # healthy, uninjured
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune to give <eol> the signals to grow <eol> tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to xxxxx disease, <eob> could <eob> instead instruct xxx immune system <eob> to build # tissues and more quickly xxxx # wounds. <eol>
Now, body xxxxx out <eob> # of xxxxxxx <eol> might seem <eob> like magic, <eol> but there <eob> are # several organisms <eol> that can # achieve this
Some xxx # regrow their the humble salamander <eob> can # completely <eol> regenerate <eob> their # arm, <eol> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after <eob> losing more than half <eob> of its # original mass.
To make this magic a # bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm xxx xxx body <eol> can heal wounds and xxxxx tissue <eob> instructions <eob> from the xxxxxxx <eol>
From # a xxxxxx on xxxx knee <eob> that sinus <eol> our immune system defends <eob> our body from xxxxxxx <eol>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> # by using I know <eol> about xxx xxxxxx defense system, I # to identify key xxxxxxx our fight # xx build # <eol> back <eol> our cuts # and bruises. <eob>
When <eob> looking at materials that are currently <eol> being <eob> tested <eol> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that treating <eob> an injured muscle with # materials, there was a number of immune cells in # that material and the surrounding # muscle. <eob>
So this case, <eob> xxxxxxx of the xxxxxx cells # rushing off <eol> towards # infection xx # xxxxxxxxx <eol> they're rushing toward xxxxxxx <eol>
I discovered a # specific type of # cell, <eob> helper T # cell, <eol> xxx present inside that <eob> material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound <eol> # healing. <eob>
Now, just # like when you were a kid <eob> you'd break pencil <eol> and try and tape it together again, <eob> can xxxxx <eob> but it not be <eol> in the most # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> and we'll get x scar.
So <eol> # xx we # don't these helper <eob> cells, instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of xxx <eob> and # if fat in our muscle, <eob> xx isn't as strong. <eob>
using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow # <eob> xxxx <eol> without these scars <eob> xxx look <eob> like what it <eob> before we were even injured.
I'm to create materials that give us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eol>
We know xxxx any # time <eol> x material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eob>
This # ranges from pacemakers insulin # pumps <eob> to materials that <eob> engineers <eob> using to <eol> and build new tissue. <eob>
So when I place # that <eol> or scaffold, in xxx <eob> body, <eob> the xxxxxx system creates <eol> a small environment # xx cells and # <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> that # can change the way <eol> that our stem xxxxx behave. <eol>
Now, just like the weather <eol> affects xxx activities, like going for x run <eob> or staying <eol> inside # xxx binge-watching <eol> an # entire TV show on <eob> # xxxxxx of a <eob> affects the <eol> our stem cells grow # and # develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong # signals, <eol> say the xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> xx <eob> get fat cells instead # of <eob> muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are xxxx <eol> xx a <eol> variety # of <eol> different things, <eob> from plastics to <eob> derived materials, <eob> of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more or <eob> less porous, <eob> gels of different <eob> stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even # xxx materials <eol> different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we # xxx <eol> orchestrate <eol> Broadway # show # of cells by giving them # the correct cues # and props <eob> that # can be xxxxxxx # for xxxxxxxxx # tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" <eob> versus xxxxxxx # <eob> Shop # of Horrors".
I'm # combining specific types of signals <eob> xxxx mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help xx regenerate. <eol>
In # <eob> the xx could xxx <eol> a scar-proof xxxxxxxxx <eob> x moldable muscle <eob> filler <eob> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, <eob> we aren't going to wake up <eol> and to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next Tuesday, # either. <eol>
But # with <eol> these advances, <eob> and working # with # our immune system <eob> to help build # tissue and # xxxx # wounds, <eob> we # could begin seeing <eob> products on # the market <eob> that work with our xxxxxx defense system <eob> to help xx <eol> xx able <eol> to xxxx pace with <eol>
you. <eob>

So, # as a child, <eob> I used <eol> to spend of <eol> my great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash xxxxxx xxx floor <eol> xxx stick my face in front of <eol> her only <eob> # air
But didn't realize that that simple experience, <eob> xxxxxx brief, <eob> was privileged # in our community. <eob>
Growing up, of xxxxxxxxx neighbors <eol> having # to # xxx fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed # normal to me. <eob>
xxxxxx winter, struggling to get warm, <eol> xx neighbors # have # no choice <eol> but to <eob> bypass the meter <eob> after their was shut off, <eob> just to keep their # family <eol> comfortable for xxx more day. <eob>
kinds of dangerous can <eol> root when people <eob> are # faced <eol> with xxxxxxxxxx choices.
In the US, xxxxxxx American spends <eol> three of xxxxx income energy.
In contrast, low-income <eob> and rural populations <eol> can spend 20, even <eol> xx percent <eob> of their income on energy. <eol>
In 2015, this <eol> million <eob> # skip <eob> # meals <eob> # provide power to their homes.
This is # xxxx energy # a burden. <eob>
But energy are so much # more <eob> than just a # <eob>
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eol> Do you take your child <eob> to <eol> her flu medicine, <eob> do you feed her? <eol>
Or do xxx keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible xxxxxxx <eol> xxx nearly every month, <eob> seven million # people choose <eol> between <eol> medicine and energy. <eob>
This xxxxxxx x # much # xxxxxx <eob> and <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob>
Families # high energy burdens <eol> disproportionately people of color, who spend more per square foot than <eol> # their counterparts. <eob>
But also xxxxxxx <eob> and even xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> who xxxx into the mass <eol> xx 37 # million people a year <eob> who xxx xxxxxx to <eol> afford <eol> for basic needs. <eob>
As a those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood # # conditions <eol> like heart disease # <eob> asthma.
Look -- given our xxxxxxx to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have # the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities.
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of # insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are # all <eob> decreasing. <eol>
However, even xx xx # approach cost parity, <eob> the majority xx those own solar earn much more than the average # American.
xxxx is why, xxxx I was 22, <eol> I founded <eol> the nonprofit # RETI. <eob>
Our xxxxxxx to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> utilities xxx agencies alike <eob> provide equitable <eol> access <eol> to # clean energy, <eob> energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology.
But xxxxxxx no one way to solve <eob> this. <eol>
believe in the power of local xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> xx relationships. <eob>
we <eob> xxxxxxx directly with the xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host # workshops <eol> and <eob> events for <eob> to learn # about energy # poverty, <eol> and how making <eob> # even # small updates to their # homes <eob> like insulation for windows <eob> and water heaters <eol> can xx a long <eob> # way # to maximize # efficiency. <eol>
We're # connecting neighborhoods <eol> to community solar and spearheading xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> home research <eol> and # xxxxxxxx <eol> xx help xxxxxxxx bring down <eol> their energy # bills. <eob>
We're # even <eol> with officials, <eol> advocating # for # equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eob> of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> we have to work together sustainably.
Now, # the US spends <eob> over three # billion a year <eob> energy xxxx assistance. <eob>
And these programs xx help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but xxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to <eob> help <eob> a fraction of xxxxx <eol> need. <eob>
fact, <eob> there is <eol> a 47-billion-dollar <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx affordability gap, <eob> so # xxxxx is not sustainable. <eol>
by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial # access to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and # affordable. <eob>
At <eob> scale, <eol> xxxxxxxxx technology, <eol> clean xxxxxxxxxx and energy efficiency xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol>
And # for xxxx xxxx energy # burdens, it can help them xxxxxxx 20 percent their income # xx <eob> 20 percent of # person's # income <eob> who's to <eob> make ends meet. <eob>
This is life-changing.
This is an # opportunity <eol> for xxxxxxxx to <eol> # use <eob> their energy # xxxxxxx <eob> to # sponsor their xxxxxxx
I think xxxx to my great-grandmother and # her neighbors, impossible choices <eol> that they had # to <eob> make <eob> xxx xxx effect # it had xx our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about xxxxx
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible today.
xxx I # know high # <eob> burdens are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to overcome, <eol> but <eob> through # <eol> with <eol> communities and technology, <eol> we xxxx paths xx xxxxxxxx them.
And when we do, <eob> we will all be # more resilient.
Thank you.

Have you xxxx watched a of birds work # together?
Thousands of animals, <eol> in perfect # synchrony: xxxxx it fascinating?
What I <eob> find remarkable is that birds <eol> would xxx be able xx do # if they all <eob> xxxxx <eob> # have <eob> to follow one leader. <eol>
Their reaction # speed would simply be too # low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that <eob> these birds are aligned <eob> a few <eob> # rules, <eol> allowing every # bird <eob> to # make autonomous # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxx still flying in perfect synchrony.
alignment enables their <eol> and # their autonomy makes them fast <eob> and flexible. <eob>
Now, # what <eol> does this have to do <eob> with one of xxx <eob>
Well, it's # one xxx of xxxxxxxxxxxx what <eol> I xxxxxxx # to the most important <eob> xxxxxx <eob> is # <eol> needed in ways of working today.
The xx getting faster <eol> and more <eob> so xx need x new xxx of working, way that creates xxxxxxxxx <eol> around xxxxxxxx <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly # empowers people <eob> to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the xxxxxxxx is: In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing # xx give <eob>
A few # years ago, <eob> # I # was # working with a that to embark <eol> # a digital transformation. <eol>
They wanted their offering to be # simpler, <eob> more intuitive, more # relevant. <eob>
sure how many you xxxx seen # a # bank from the <eob> so let me try # to illustrate what traditional banks <eol> look xxxxx <eol>
xxx see # lots of people # in suits <eob> taking elevators xx go <eob> to their department, <eol> marketers sitting xxxx # marketers, <eol> engineers with # engineers, etc.
You see meetings with # 20 people <eol> nothing # gets # decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eol>
there are endless handovers <eol> departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever.
So xxxx bank knew <eob> that # in xxxxx <eol> to transform, <eol> they would to # improve <eol> their time # to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their # working xx well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
get some we decided <eol> to # go and have a look xxxxxxxxx that xxxx to be innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.
And <eol> I remember how xx were walking <eol> the halls at one # these # December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx consultant and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt # like # <eol> strangers # in a strange land, xxxxxxxxxx by beanbags and hoodies xxx xxxx <eob> of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we xxxxxx xxxx is your # organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an xxx # chart.
But xxxxxxxx they xxxx <eob> strange # drawings with funny xxxxx # like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and # xxxxxxxx to explain how # they # were organized. <eob>
So then xx # to # translate <eob> that <eol> to our own world. <eol>
We asked, xxxx <eob> many people <eol> are for you?" <eob> "It
"Who do you to?" <eol> "It depends".
"Who <eob> decides on # your priorities?" <eob> "It
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We <eol> were asking for xxxx <eob> we thought were # of basic principles <eol> <eob> and their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, the course of that <eob> we <eob> gained better <eol> # their model. <eob>
They believed in the power of small, autonomous teams. <eol>
Their teams were like <eol>
They <eob> had product people and IT engineers in xxx same team <eob> so <eob> they could # <eol> design, build and test ideas with customers independently xx others <eob> in the company. <eob>
# not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the needed xxxxx there in the team. <eob>
Now, at the <eob> end of # that <eob> had a session <eol> to reflect # on what we had learned. <eol>
And we had started to like # their model, <eob> so we were thinking of how <eol> to apply some # of these ideas # to x <eol>
But then, one of <eob> the hosts, <eol> guy who xxx xxx said <eob> a word all <eol> day, <eol> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see you our model. <eob>
But I have one <eob> question # xxx you: <eol> What are you <eob> willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give xxx
did # not have an answer immediately, <eob> but we knew # he xxx right. <eol>
Change # is not # only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> about giving up on some of the old well. <eob>
Now, over # the past five years, have xxxxxx with companies xxx over the world to xxxxxx their # ways of <eob> working. <eol>
And xxxxxxxx # xxxxx company <eob> has their skeptics about why this is <eob> xxx <eol> going <eob> # <eob> work for <eol> # them. <eob>
"Our product is more <eol> complex," <eol> or # "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like we do," or "Regulators just won't # xxxx in our industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx and also <eol> for xxx other companies <eol> that I <eol> xxxx worked with <eol> change xxx <eob>
a year, we completely blew up # the old silos <eol> between marketing, <eob> product, <eob> channels and IT. <eol>
Three # thousand employees xxxx reorganized xxxx 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So of xxxxxxx people <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx # with product people <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxx with engineers, <eob> x person and an engineer <eob> were now members <eob> # of the same team.
You # could be x member of a team responsible <eob> # for account opening <eob> or xxx the mobile <eol> # banking app, <eob>
At the xxxxxxx date <eol> of that new organization, some # people shaking xxxxx for the very first time, <eob> only xx find out that # they had # been sitting two minutes # xxxx from <eob> other <eob> but they were # sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for xxx last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone # <eol> saying, "Ah, so xxxxxx xxx guy xxxx I <eob> was always chasing for <eob> answers". <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eob> together # xxxxx day. <eob>
If the product guy has # an idea, he can just raise # it <eob> get input from <eol> the <eol> engineer who # is sitting right # next xx him.
They can to # test <eol> with # customers immediately -- <eob> no # no PowerPoints, no red # tape, <eob> just getting stuff done. <eol>
Now, # getting there is not easy. <eob>
as it xxxxx out, <eol> "What are you willing to give up?" <eol> exactly the <eol> right # question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams.
Instead of decisions going <eob> up # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx we want the <eob> team to <eob> decide. <eob>
But to # do so, we <eob> need all # the <eol> xxxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxx for that decision <eob> xx the team. <eol>
And this xxxxxx difficult trade-offs. <eol>
Can we <eob> physically co-locate our people xxx # are in different buildings, different <eob> cities # or even <eob> countries today? <eob>
Or should xx xxxxxx in xxxxxx videoconferencing? <eol>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way <eob> we do # things <eob> across <eob> these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eob> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all changes <eob> to structure <eob> and # process and procedure -- <eol> they are xxx easy.
But xx the end, <eob> I found that the most difficult thing to <eob> change is our own <eol>
Let try xx illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, # like # mini-start-up, <eob> they # have # to be xxxxxxxxx and autonomous.
But this means we cannot # have leaders <eol> commanding their xxxxxx what to do, <eol> when to do, how to do.
No micromanagers. <eol>
But it <eob> also means xxxx # each employee needs to become a leader, regardless of # their formal title.
It's about all of us stepping <eob> to # initiative. <eob>
Now xxxxxxxxxx we also cannot <eol> to have all these # teams <eol> running # in xxxxxxxxx # directions, <eob> because that would <eob> xxxxxxxxx lead xx chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment # autonomy <eol> at the same xxxxx just a of birds. <eob>
In xx organizational xxxxxxxx this requires new behaviors, <eob> xxxx each new # behavior, <eob> there is <eol> # giving up xx something xxx as <eob> well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure that xxxxxxxx in the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx aligned around <eol> the overall # purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall -- the what. <eob>
But then # they have to # go <eol> and trust xxxxx to # make the right decisions <eob> on how to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But # you # know how they say <eob> information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some # managers, <eob> sharing may # feel if <eol> xxxxxx up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just xxxxxxxxx <eob>
The teams need <eob> to <eob> communicate <eol> openly and # transparently <eol> as well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and the end # of every <eol> they <eob> # organize # a demo session <eob> to <eol> share xxx output <eol> of what <eob> they've done, # <eob> transparently. <eob>
xxxxx day, <eob> xxxx member of <eob> gives <eob> an xxxxxx <eob> of what they are working individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable xxx <eob> because suddenly, there is <eob> place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do is # transparent for # everyone. <eol>
So, alignment xx <eol> not easy, xxx autonomy is not <eob> so xxxxxxxx # either.
One executive at another # company likes xx explain how he used to xx <eob> a # of <eob>
Now, today, # know how <eol> things are going, <eob> instead xx <eol> xxxxxxx at reports, <eob> he # needs walk down to the team floors <eol> to # attend xxx xxxxx sessions. <eol>
And instead <eob> of xxxxxxx people # what # to xxx <eol> # # ways to # help them.
That # is xxxxxxx change xxx someone # xxx # xxxx to be a of # milestone-tracking.
But <eob> in <eob> # # old world, # this xxxxxxxxx # said, "I # had the # control. <eol>
xx reality, <eob> projects xxxxx run <eob> over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
Now I have much transparency, <eol> xxx I xxx course-correct <eol> much earlier # if needed". <eob>
xxx middle <eob> need to <eob> change as well. <eob>
First # of xxxx the xxxxxxxxx <eob> and the PowerPoint, xxxxxxx less # of a xxxx <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx
And in the there was <eob> this idea xx # thinkers and # doers. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx would # xxxx follow orders.
But now, instead # only managing other people, <eob> middle managers were expected to # become player-coaches. <eol>
So imagine, for last 10 xxxxxx <eol> you have just been xxxxxxx # people what to do, <eol> but now you're expected xx xx things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
Clearly, xxxx <eob> is <eob> xxx for xxxxxxxxx and some great people the
But <eob> the result a xxx <eob> with # less xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And <eob> all # of # this # hard xxxxx <eob>
it's worth it. <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx that I worked with, <eob> they were used new product features # a xxx # times per year. <eol>
Now they every few # weeks, <eob> xxx without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And if # you the xxxxx <eol> of these companies today, you just # feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels <eol> if # you're walking <eol> the halls # of a very large <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eob> xxxx cannot # claim xxxxxxx xxxx <eol>
But at least with this new xxxxxx they are # much better prepared <eob> to respond to change. <eob>
The is getting faster <eol> xxx more <eob> so xx need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of # change <eob> is not # in structure <eob> or process or procedure, and <eob> it's xxxx # not just <eol> senior xxxxxxxxxx taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will # be all # <eob> xx the organization <eol> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have <eob> to lead the <eob> change. <eob>
So the question # is: <eob> What are you <eol> to # give up?
xxxxx you. <eob>

Whether <eob> they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through xxxxxxxx <eol> they are in new xxxxxx <eob> every day, week <eol> or month.
As long as <eob> they # can find good # <eob> Wi-Fi, <eol> care where are. <eol>
Our # on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It # was conscious choice <eol> from # xxx <eob> xxxx beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't <eob> use the word # <eob> because sets up # the expectation, that # some xxxxxx are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" to describe what we do, <eol> where everyone is <eol> xx # an equal playing field.
I think a distributed workforce is # the most effective xxx to build a <eol>
The key is you have # xx <eol> it consciously. <eol>
xxxx xx WordPress, many of <eol> xxx 20 hires people I'd xxxxx met in person. <eob>
But collaborated # <eol> online, <eol> sometimes # for years. <eob>
I wanted xx <eol> continue xxx one simple reason. <eol>
x believe talent and intelligence are equally distributed throughout the world. <eol> But xxxxxxxxxxx is xxxx <eol>
In # Silicon # xxxxxxx <eol> big tech # companies # from essentially <eol> the xxxx small # pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company can fish # xxxx the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of <eol> hiring someone # <eob> who grew up <eol> xx Japan but lives # in California, xxx can # gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to # sleep <eob> wherever they are in the <eob> bring a different <eob> understanding of <eob> xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and a # different # lived experience. <eob>
At <eob> # the base of the # <eob> decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's xxxxxx to people autonomy they do # their work. <eob>
Unless # # in a role <eol> where # specific are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> you can # make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can # have a # corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they <eob> xxxx to eat, <eob> you can choose there's xxxxx <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eob> the room should be. <eol>
You save xxx time <eol> xxxxx spend commuting <eol> xxx <eob> put xx into things <eol> that are important <eol> to # you. <eob>
A # distributed workforce is a technology company. <eol>
But people # xxxxx ask me, <eol> "This works # great for y'all, but xxxx about everyone else?" <eol> If have # office, you xxx a # few things <eol> to # build distributed # capability. <eob>
First: # document everything. <eob>
an office, easy to make decisions # the moment, <eol> in the kitchen, in <eob>
But if people # <eol> work remotely <eob> and some of <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't # have access to, <eob> see these decisions <eob> being <eob> made <eol> without understanding why. <eob>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eol> and what you were <eob> thinking about.
This to pick up <eol> where you xxxx off. <eob>
xx allows people in # different <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great xx think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eol> xxxxxx and # joining. <eob>
Try to # have # xx much communication <eob> as possible online. <eol>
xxxx everything's and xxxxxxx <eol> it allows new people to # catch quickly. <eob>
You also # xxxx to find the right <eob>
There are # so many apps and # services <eol> that help <eol> xxxx day-to-day # <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # changed how # <eob> you <eol> probably aren't objects xxxxxxxx
They're # things you <eob> access <eol> your computer. <eol>
So # with <eol> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what <eol> works.
# productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional # office, <eob> xxxxxx in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out xx the year <eob> and you might have three or four weeks apart.
We try to flip that: we come xxxxxxxx for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once x year we do a grand meet-up where the # entire company <eol> comes xxxxxxxx # for a xxxxx <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is connecting people. <eob> xx xx xxxx sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on <eob> same # <eol> and they have a xxxxxx # connection <eob> with their colleagues. <eol>
When they work # together the rest of # the xxxxx <eob> xxxx can bring # together <eol> # understanding and empathy.
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the <eob> flexibility <eob> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every # <eob> person # <eob> at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend that # <eol> towards a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> or just to buy coffee, <eob> so they don't <eol> get kicked xxx # of the coffee shop. <eol>
One xxxxx in Seattle <eol> to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a xxxxxxxxx # fishing pier. <eol>
Each joins # xxx company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This they can invest <eob> in getting # the right chair, xxxxxxxx <eol> the right desk setup, so can <eol> have <eol> the # productive environment xxx them. <eob>
Today, # there are # just a few # companies that distributed # first. <eol>
In a decade or # two, <eob> I <eol> that percent companies <eob> that # are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eol> xxx going to function # way. <eol>
will xxxxxx to distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by xxxxx are. <eob>
xx you think xxxxx <eol> what you're to build next, <eol> consider how you can tap <eol> into global <eol> talent, <eob> give # people xx # live and work <eol> where they # they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it xx that you're <eob> creating xxxxxxxxx
