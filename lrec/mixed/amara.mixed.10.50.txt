Imagine waking up # to a stranger -- sometimes # multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eob> and worried for your <eol> safety. <eob>
Welcome <eob> to xxx world <eol> of cyberharassment. <eob>
kind of harassment <eob> that women <eol> face in Pakistan is serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps <eob> women from accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge.
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is # the sixth most <eob> populous <eol> country in the <eob> world, <eob> with <eob> 140 million people having access to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the # rise xx new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also <eob> the birthplace <eol> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eol> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.
Another aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their <eob> bodies; <eob> where men xxx allowed to # disrespect women <eob> and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name so-called <eob> "family honor"; <eob> where # women are xxxx to die <eol> right xxxxxxx their houses <eob> for speaking to a man <eob> on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name <eob> of "family honor".
Let <eol> me say this very # clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eol> it's # xxxxxxxxxxxx murder. <eob>
I come from a very xxxxx village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are # allowed <eol> to pursue their xxxxxx education.
The elders of my xxxxxxxx family didn't allow their women <eob> to pursue their # education <eol> xx xxxxx professional <eob>
However, unlike <eol> other <eol> male guardians of <eob> my family, my father <eob> was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get xx law degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there # were] frowns of <eob> disapproval.
But xx end, I knew <eol> it's either me or # them, and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause)
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a <eol> mobile <eol> phone <eob> until I was married. <eob>
And even when I xxx married, <eob> this tool xxxxxx x tool <eol> for my # own surveillance. <eob>
When # I resisted this <eob> idea <eol> of being surveilled <eol> by my ex-husband, he # really didn't approve of <eol> and threw me out of house, <eob> with my six-month-old <eob> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the # time when I first asked # myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal xxxxxx <eob> enshrined in Constitution? <eol>
While the states that # a woman <eob> has same equal access <eob> to the information, <eob> why # xx it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- xxx # are granting these rights to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to take a step, <eob> instead of keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal <eob> and societal norms.
And founded the Digital <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues <eol> and <eol> women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From <eob> lobbying free and safe internet <eol> to convincing young women <eob> that access to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, right, <eol> I'm trying to play my part <eob> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have bothered me all these years.
With a hope xx my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I xxxxxxx Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- (Applause) <eol>
to extend my <eob> support to the women <eol> who do not know <eol> who to turn to <eob> when they serious threats online. <eol>
I think of the xxxxx who do not have <eol> the necessary support to deal with the <eol> mental <eob> trauma <eol> when they unsafe in online spaces, <eol> and they go about their # daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access # to the internet <eol> is access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom.
When I # fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting <eob> for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
<eob>
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, xxxxxxx us <eob> to the wrong objectives.
this is unacceptable. <eob>
This has xx stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs? <eol>
How are we going to # choose the right course? <eob>
It's not xxxxx to be easy. <eol>
For years, I've xxxxxx xxxx talented teams <eol> they've # chosen the right objectives <eob> and the wrong objectives. <eol>
Many have succeeded, others of them have failed. <eob>
And today # I'm going <eob> to share <eob> with you <eol> what really a difference -- <eol> that's what's crucial, how and <eob> they set meaningful and audacious xxxxxx <eob> the # right goals # <eol> for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, <eob> xxxx is me. <eol>
I've <eob> got a lot to learn, <eol> a computer <eol> engineer, I've got long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eol> who's been called the greatest manager <eol> of his or xxx other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, <eob> it almost doesn't matter what you xxxxx <eol>
Execution xx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and # Key Results". <eob>
kind xx rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video <eob> from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management xx # systems <eob> xxx <eob> the objectives and xxx key results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction.
The key results have to be measured, but at the xxx you can look <eol> and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I # do that, or did I do that?" Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
Objectives and Key Results, or xxxxx <eol> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for organizations, xxxx work for teams, <eob> they even work xxx individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eob> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's <eol> the truth: <eol> many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eob>
They ship their <eob> sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> they <eob> make their numbers, <eob> but xxxx lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams.
So how do you set these goals the right <eob> way? <eob>
First, you must answer the question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine their ambitions <eol> to their passion and to <eob> their purpose, <eob> and they develop a # clear <eob> and compelling of why. <eol>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim.
She runs a called xxxxx <eob>
Nuna is <eol> a health care data company.
And when was # founded, <eol> they used data to serve the health needs of xxxx of xxxxxxx at large companies. <eob>
And then two years into the company's # <eob> life, <eob> the xxxxxxx government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid. <eol>
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> this database <eob> had <eol> to xx built in one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eol> xxxx they had to honor, <eob> and they weren't # going to make <eol> very money on the project. <eob>
This <eol> was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not <eob>
Why? <eol>
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, he had his # first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland.
xx fell to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean <eob> immigrants. <eob>
They came <eob> to the country <eob> with limited resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini <eob> to xxxxxx family in Medicaid. <eob>
She # was nine years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her <eob> mission, and # that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on # that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: <eob> saved # my from bankruptcy, <eob> xxx today it # provides xxx health <eol> and <eol> for millions of others.
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with # dignity. <eob>
JD: # And Jini's # <eob> story tells <eol> us that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eob> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> they <eol> are inspiring, and they're a # <eol> kind of xxxxxxx against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eol> would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, has used OKRs <eob> to # wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx ONE <eol> has <eol> focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for the poorest countries in the world.
The next is <eol> universal access <eob> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good objectives?
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? # Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes.
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen # to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your <eob> passion <eol> xxxx you to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eob> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion <eob> means nothing.
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained # inside it. <eob>
It gives xx an xxxxxxxxxxx for # risk, for trust, <eob> failing is not a # fireable offense. <eob>
And when you have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eob> magic is around xxx corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right # around the corner.
This is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, with <eob> Bono the whats # of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's <eob> turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, <eol> the hows are the key results. <eol> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eob> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're xxxxxxxxxx but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those # are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey.
# <eob> they are, <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
not quite. <eob>
What # he really said was, <eob> "We # have <eol> any other way <eob> to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
And I took that xx a kind of endorsement.
But every since then, every Googler has written # down <eol> her objectives her key results.
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or <eob> # for promotions. <eol>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's get collective commitment <eob> to # truly stretch goals. <eob>
In xxxxx a Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eob> took on an objective which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform the future web -- <eol> in other words, build the browser.
He was thoughtful <eob> about how he chose his key results.
How xx you measure the xxxx # browser? <eob>
It could # <eob> be # ad clicks or engagement.
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide <eol> Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
he had <eob> this one <eol> objective: <eob> build # <eob> the best <eob> browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but <eol> he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his <eol> goal # <eol> was 20 million users <eol> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eol>
Second # year, he raised the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He # got to # 37 # million users. <eob>
Somewhat better.
In the third # year, <eob> he upped the # <eob> ante <eol> once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eob> improved the technology, kaboom! <eob>
He <eob> got 111 <eob>
Here's why I # like this story, <eol> not so much for # the happy ending, <eol> but it # shows someone carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a # perfect story for a nerd <eol> like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eob> that # are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What <eob> really matters is the why that pour into those <eob> vessels. <eob>
That's why we xx our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not <eob> # going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eol> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but <eob> when those xxxxxxxxxxxx are in place, <eol> they can take you to <eol> the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think <eob> about your life for # a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, your objectives <eob> and your # key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eob> you can send # <eob> to # me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, <eob> xxxxxxx remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access # to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eol> every one of those goals is <eob> today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've xxxx called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, but I want you <eol> to join me <eol> in this movement.
Let's xxxxx # for # what it is <eol> that really matters, <eob> because we can take xxxx beyond our businesses. <eob>
We can take them # to our families, to our schools, even to our # governments. <eol>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eol>
We # can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can get back on right track <eob> if xx can and do measure <eol> what really matters.
Thank # you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
What is history? <eol>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype <eob> that history should be focused on the rulers, <eob> Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> xxxx # at # history # as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or determined by the leaders, and xxxxxx people could <eob> not influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians <eob> xxxxx # do not believe <eob> that # Russia could ever have been or ever will be # x truly democratic nation, <eob> and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And <eob> this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eob> of my # life trying to go 100 years back, <eol> to year <eob> 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I asked # myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last # year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com.
My team and I created software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eob> all real diaries and letters <eol> written by # more than 3,000 people <eol> 100 years ago. <eob>
So <eol> any user of our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow a news feed <eol> for each day of <eob> 1917 <eob> and read what people <eob> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like # you and me, <eob> not demigods, and # we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius ideas".
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eob> used to that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eol> and the ideas xx freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, just because <eol> was not our destiny. <eob>
But if we take a broader # look, <eob> it's not that black # and white. <eol>
Yes, 1917 led to # <eol> 70 years <eol> of communist # dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we xxx that Russia <eob> could have had a different history <eob> xxx a democratic future, <eob> as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one of first ones to grant women rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary # people influenced history can <eol> help us create # better <eol> future, <eol> because history is <eob> just # <eol> a rehearsal of what's happening right now. <eob>
We do need new ways of <eol> telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, <eob> xx started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and <eob> that is an online documentary series that gives you an impression of that year, 1968, <eol> a year marked by global social # change <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the world as we <eob> know it now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx <eob> history alive by xx all the main xxxxx use mobile phones ... <eol> just like that?
And we see that a # lot individuals <eob> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same values, <eol> matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in <eob> China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people power <eol> are not <eol> the only ones making choices. <eob>
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers # <eob> matter.
We shape society.
We all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at # a massive scale, <eol> using human-like # intelligence. <eol>
And intelligence of computers <eol> is <eob> # <eob> often referred xx as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in the future.
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges in detecting diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eol> such as # infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands patients every year <eob> lose xxxxx lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our # way to these patients <eob> is # <eob> to perform early xxxxxxxxx <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eol>
So how do we detect # these diseases today, <eol> xxx # artificial intelligence help?
In patients # who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eol> an expert physician first orders very <eol> expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those images and talks to the xxxxxxxx <eob>
As xxx can see, <eob> this is <eol> a very resource-intensive xxxxxxxx <eol> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is not considered practical <eob> for the developing world. <eob>
And <eob> # fact, many <eob> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can we solve this problem using intelligence? <eob>
Today, if I were to use traditional <eol> artificial # intelligence <eol> to solve <eol> this problem, I <eol> xxxxx require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 of these very medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, x would xxxx go to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze those images <eob> for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of <eol> information, <eob> I xxx train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning <eob> network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx # first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we # <eol> more scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing # us <eob> today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at xxx Media Lab does. <eol>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures <eob> to some of the most important challenges facing us <eob> today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In the example I shared <eol> with <eob> you today, had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted # to reduce <eob> the <eob> use of expensive medical imaging to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eob> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we <eol> started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team and I <eol> figured out a clever way <eob> to extract billions of information packets. <eob>
These information packets included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eol> xxx rendering of the disease on the medical image. <eob>
In a sense, we converted one image <eol> xxxx billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data <eob> needed for training. <eol>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive imaging <eob> technologies to screen # patients, <eob> we started with # a standard, <eol> xxxxx <eob> light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> xxxxxxxx of information packets? <eol>
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, <eol> creating something <eol> that we call x composite image. <eob>
Much to our surprise, <eol> we only <eol> required 50 -- I repeat, only 50 -- <eol> of these composite images to xxxxx <eol> our algorithms to high <eol> efficiencies.
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of # using 10,000 very expensive medical <eol> we # can now train the AI algorithms <eol> in an unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 # of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from <eob> DSLR cameras <eol> and <eol> mobile phones, and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, <eol> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the and even right now, <eob> xxxx # very simple, white light <eol> photographs from the <eob> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies.
I xxxxxxx that we are <eol> to enter an era <eob> where <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make an incredible <eol> impact xx our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking about traditional AI, xxxxx xx # data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> problems facing <eob> us today, especially in health care. <eol>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just getting over <eol> # a cold, <eob> you heal your wounds faster? <eol>
Today, if we xxxx <eol> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to <eob> materials <eob> that instruct our <eob> immune system to give us <eol> the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct our body <eob> to # fight disease, <eol> we # could instead instruct our immune system <eob> to build tissues <eol> and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, <eob> regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eol> but there are xxxxxxx organisms that can achieve this feat. <eob>
lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, and even # us mere humans <eol> can regrow our # liver <eob> after xxxxxx more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eob>
To make this magic a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the xxxxxx system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that annoying sinus infection, our immune system defends our xxxx from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eol> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eol> our cuts and bruises. <eol>
When looking at materials <eol> that <eob> are currently being # tested <eol> xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eol> our team noticed <eol> that after treating <eol> an injured # muscle with these materials, <eol> there # was a large number of immune cells <eob> in that xxxxxxxx <eol> the surrounding muscle. <eob>
So in this case, <eob> of # the immune cells rushing off <eol> towards to fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward an injury.
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, the helper T xxxxx was # present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like xxxx you <eob> were a kid <eol> and you'd break your <eob> pencil <eob> and <eob> try and tape it back together again, we can heal, <eob> but # it might not be <eob> in # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have <eol> these helper # T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx xx it, <eol> and xx there's fat <eol> in our <eob> muscle, it isn't as strong.
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back <eol> without these # scars <eob> and look like # what xx was <eob> before we were even injured.
I'm working to xxxxxx materials <eob> that <eob> give us # the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that xxx time a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the # immune system will respond <eob> to it.
This ranges <eob> from pacemakers <eol> to <eob> insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new <eob>
So when I # place that material, or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the <eob> immune system creates x small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the way <eob> that our stem cells behave. <eol>
Now, like the weather <eol> affects # our daily activities, <eob> like going <eob> for a run <eob> or staying inside and binge-watching <eol> xx entire <eob> TV xxxx on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that <eob> xxx stem <eob> cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, we get fat cells instead of # muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eob> from <eob> plastics to naturally <eob> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that more or less porous, <eob> gels # of different stiffnesses.
And researchers <eob> can even make the materials <eob> release different xxxxxxx over time. <eob>
So in other <eol> words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving # them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that # can be changed for different tissues, just like a producer would <eob> change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of xxxxxxx <eob> that mimic how our body responds to xxxxxx <eol> to <eob> help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we <eob> could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, we aren't going to up tomorrow <eol> and xx able to <eob> heal like <eol> Wolverine. <eol>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune <eob> system <eol> to help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eob> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be xxxx <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

So, xx a child, I xxxx # to spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house.
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eob> and stick my face in front xx her only air conditioner.
But <eol> I didn't realize that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eol> was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door # neighbors having to # set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eol> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, <eob> struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eol> after their heat was shut off, just to keep their family <eob> comfortable for one more xxxx <eob>
These kinds of dangerous <eol> incidents can <eob> take root <eol> when people <eol> are faced <eol> with <eob> impossible choices. <eob>
In the average American spends <eol> three percent of # their income on energy. <eol>
In contrast, # <eob> low-income and rural populations can spend xxx even 30 percent <eol> of their income energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is <eob> when energy becomes a # burden. <eol>
xxx energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible and perilous choices: <eol> Do you take your <eol> child <eob> to get xxx flu medicine, <eob> or # <eob> do you feed her? <eol>
Or do you keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, and # every month, <eol> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eob> and xxxxxxxx issue. <eol>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people # of color, who spend more per foot <eob> than # their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans <eol> and even schoolteachers who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs.
As a result, those with high energy burdens <eob> have a greater xxxxxxxxxx of xxxxxxxxxx like heart and asthma. <eob>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our xxxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we have the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is xxxxx
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx and smart home technology <eob> are xxx decreasing. <eol>
However, even as we # cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than # xxx average American. <eob>
xxxx is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded the # nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> xxxxxxxxx and government agencies alike <eob> xx provide <eob> equitable access <eol> to clean energy, energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in the power <eol> of xxxxx communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eob>
So we start by <eob> working directly <eol> with the communities <eol> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities to learn <eob> about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eob> updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eol> can go long way <eol> to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods to # community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research and installation programs <eob> to help families bring down <eol> their energy bills. <eol>
even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eol> advocating xxx more equitable xxxxxxxx <eob> because see this vision <eol> of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> have to work together <eol> sustainably. <eob>
US <eob> spends <eob> over three xxxxxxx # a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but <eol> they're only able to help <eob> a fraction those in need. <eob>
In fact, <eol> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> xx assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into # our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and <eob> impartial access <eob> to energy # that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable.
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency dramatically improve <eol> public health. <eob>
And for those with high xxxxxx burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim <eob> 20 percent of their income -- <eol> 20 percent of a person's income <eol> who's struggling to make # ends meet. <eob>
xxxx # is life-changing. <eob>
This is an opportunity <eob> for # to # use their <eob> energy savings <eob> sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eol> and her <eob> neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eol> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had on our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about them. <eob>
There millions nationwide <eob> having <eob> to # make the same impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to them. <eob>
And when <eob> we do, we will all be more resilient. <eol>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of # birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable <eob> that # these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eol> if they all <eob> would have <eol> to follow <eol> one leader.
Their reaction speed would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists <eob> believe <eol> that these birds aligned on <eol> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eol> to autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect xxxxxxxxxx
Their alignment # enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eob> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eob> with any one of us? <eol>
Well, it's <eol> one way of illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the most important xxxxxx <eol> that <eob> is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting <eol> xxx more # complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that creates <eob> around purpose, <eol> that takes out bureaucracy and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions # faster. <eob>
But the question is: <eob> In order to get there, what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was xxxxxxx with a bank that wanted to embark <eob> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They wanted their offering to be <eol> more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen a bank <eob> from the <eob> so me try to # illustrate <eol> what many <eob> traditional xxxxx look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to # go <eob> to their department, marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers engineers, etc. <eol>
You see meetings with 20 people <eob> where # nothing decided.
Great ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eob> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything # can take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have <eob> to improve <eol> their time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eob> their ways of working as well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> to go and have <eol> a look at companies <eob> xxxx seem to # be more <eob> innovative, xxxx # Google, Netflix, # <eob> Spotify, Zappos.
And I remember how we were walking the halls at one these companies <eol> in December xxxxx <eol> a management <eob> consultant <eol> and team of # bankers. <eob>
We felt like xxxxxxxxx in a land, surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots of smart, creative employees. <eol>
So then <eob> we asked, "How your company <eob> organized?" And we expected to xxx an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with <eob> funny names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" to how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to <eol> our own world. <eol>
We asked, "How <eol> many xxxxxx <eob> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
xx were for what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles of <eol> organizations, <eob> their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, the course of that <eob> day, <eol> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model.
They believed <eol> in the power <eol> small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers independently of others in the company.
did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eol> right there in the team. <eol>
Now, at the end of that we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started xx like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how <eob> to apply <eob> some of these <eob> ideas to a bank. <eol>
But then, one of the hosts, <eob> a guy who had not said x xxxx all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I you like # our model. <eol>
But I have one question for you: What are willing to give up?" What were <eol> we # willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> we knew he <eob> was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eob> embracing the new; it's about giving up <eol> xx some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, over xxx past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their ways of working. <eol>
xxx clearly, every company <eol> has their own skeptics <eob> about why is not <eol> going to work for them. <eob>
xxxx <eob> # <eob> product is more <eob> or "They don't have <eol> xxx legacy IT like we do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for this # bank and also <eob> for the other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change # was possible. <eob>
Within a year, xx completely <eol> xxxx up the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> product, channels and # IT.
Three # thousand employees were xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
xx instead of product people <eob> sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a product person and # an engineer xxxx now members of the same team. <eob>
You could <eob> be member of a team <eob> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> of <eob> that new organization, <eob> some were shaking hands <eol> for the very first time, <eob> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other emails <eol> and <eob> status reports for the last 10 years. <eob>
You would # hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so you're the <eob> guy that I was always chasing answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together every # day.
If the product guy has an <eol> idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get from xxx engineer who sitting right next to him. <eol>
They can decide <eob> to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, just xxxxxxx stuff <eob> done. <eob>
Now, getting there xx <eol> not easy. <eob>
as it xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you willing to give <eol> up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and down the organization, <eol> want the xxxx to <eob>
But to do so, we need all the skills <eob> expertise for that decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different # countries today? <eob>
Or should we # invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eol>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do things <eob> across these teams?
We still need <eol> some kind <eol> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes xx structure and and # -- <eob> they are not easy. <eol>
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Let me try to illustrate. <eol>
If we want these teams to be xxxxx <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, <eob> xxxx have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders <eol> xxxxxxxxxx their people what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But xx xxxx xxxxx that each employee <eol> needs <eol> to <eob> xxxxxx a leader, <eol> regardless <eol> of their formal title. <eol>
It's about of us stepping up to take initiative. <eol>
Now obviously, # also cannot # <eob> to have all these xxxxx <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because that would <eol> certainly <eol> lead chaos. <eob>
xx # we need alignment and # autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eob> just <eob> like flock of birds.
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and with # each new behavior, <eob> there is up <eol> on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eob> that everyone the organization is aligned around the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall priorities -- the what.
But then they have to let go <eol> and # trust their teams <eob> to xxxx xxx right decisions <eol> on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But you know how say <eol> that is a source of power?
Well, for some managers, <eol> sharing information may feel as if <eob> they're giving up that source of power. <eol>
And it's not just # managers. <eob>
The teams to communicate <eol> openly <eob> and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eob> each # member of the team gives an update <eob> of what they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, <eob> all this transparency <eol> can <eob> be uncomfortable for <eob> people, <eol> because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything do <eol> is for everyone. <eol>
xxx alignment is not easy, <eob> and providing autonomy <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at xxxxxxx company <eol> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down xx the team floors to attend one of # their xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And instead of telling people what do, <eob> he looks for ways # to help them. <eob>
That is radical change <eob> for xxxxxxx who used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control.
In reality, many projects would run over time and over <eob> budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have # much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if needed". <eob>
And middle managers need to change as # well.
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, there's less of a need <eob> for xxxxxx managers.
And in the old world, there was <eob> xxxx idea of thinkers and <eol> doers.
Employees would just xxxxxx orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other people, <eob> middle managers were <eol> xx become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, the last years, <eol> you have just been telling <eol> other people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eol> and some great people # leave the company. <eol>
the result is a new culture <eol> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all xx this is hard work. <eob>
But <eob> # it's worth it.
The companies that I worked with, they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per <eob>
Now xxxx have releases every few <eob> and # xxxxxxx the handovers <eob> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if # walking <eol> the halls of a very # xxxxx start-up. <eob>
Now, to be # fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory <eol>
But at least with this xxx # model, <eob> they are # much xxxxxx prepared <eol> to respond # to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is <eol> xxx xx structure <eol> or or procedure, <eob> and <eob> it's also not just <eol> senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of those <eol> in the # organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
A leader is steady, <eob> # firm, <eob> decisive, # unwavering. <eob>
Never let 'em xxx you sweat, <eol> have an answer. <eob>
[The Way We Work] <eob> My name is # Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at # a global creative consultancy.
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the <eol> character I xxxxxxx on Instagram. <eol>
As I thought my double life, I couldn't help but xxxxxx ... <eob>
When your xxxx self <eob> is a little <eob> nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to xxx <eob>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eol>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eob> I thought there # <eol> one way to be <eob> x leader: <eol> decisive and serious. <eob>
But not me. <eol>
So I'd put on <eol> basically office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in <eol> my hand motions. <eob>
someone who gets really excited about things, <eob> so I'd temper that. <eob>
x had this little voice in <eob> my # head, telling me, "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had xxx well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. <eol> And that's <eol>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eol>
Cut to: me in # a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I up as my favorite <eob> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eol> thinking friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy. <eol>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first # it was pure # fun. <eob>
I started these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about happy it made them, how it encouraged them to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell that <eol> little voice in my head to just xxxx up <eob> and let xxxxxx be me. <eob>
But then things got <eob> a little too big.
Carrie # was everywhere -- <eol> In the xxxx York # Post", "US # Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eol> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eob> still <eob> respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" I thought was # going to have to <eol> get a different job. <eob>
But something happened, <eob> something small. <eob>
I got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, <eol> "Wow, xxxxxxx <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eob>
And <eob> it let me put that little, <eol> scared voice away and just # be excited about this whole new world, <eol> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one xxxxxxx <eob> sometimes <eob> all it takes one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became <eob> more open, <eol> more playful with me, it was as if knowing this <eob> other side of me <eob> them permission <eol> to be more of themselves as # xxxxx <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eob>
But <eol> xxxx done the opposite. <eob>
Two years in, <eob> I never imagined that this <eol> part of me # not just be embraced, <eob> but could actually help my career. <eol>
Now, I'm <eol> lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, <eob> in an office xxxxx <eol> creativity valued <eol> and I xxx already pretty established <eol> in my <eol> when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's <eob> you, maybe it isn't.
all of this has taught <eol> me so much about just importance <eol> of bringing your xxxxx xxxx to work. <eob>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions about what it takes be xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
There's no one kind of # way to be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding xxxx strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting <eob> was hard, I'd put on my perfect # <eob> mask. <eob>
Now, I can <eol> say, <eob> "Gosh, that xxx frustrating". <eol>
We can talk about challenges <eol> and struggles in an way, <eob> than everybody pretending <eob> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eob> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different.
What's most xxxxxxxxxxx to me, though, <eol> is that in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eol> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eob> xxx all of our strange <eol> inner voices <eob> have a long way # to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big xxxxxxxxxx between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a little late. <eob>
Personally, I'm taking # all this <eol> as a call # to be the # ally <eob> who, like my # boss did for me, <eol> lets # people know that it's xx to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud of your ethnic background, <eob> have x disability <eol> or are deeply <eob> religious, see what it's like being <eol> your full self # at work. <eol>
You might <eob> be pleasantly <eob> surprised. <eob>
The basic problem <eol> with xxxxxxx in an office <eol> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
[The <eol> # Way We Work] <eol> Howdy, my name is xxxxx <eob> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, the <eob> company behind # WordPress.com, and xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

Whether they are in RVs or traveling through Airbnbs, they are new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> don't care <eob> xxxxx they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> the very beginning. <eob>
I don't use the word "remote," because it sets up expectation, that some <eob> people are essential <eol> and # some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on an # equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> to build a company. <eob>
The <eob> # key is # you have to approach # it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, many <eob> of the first 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
wanted to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout # the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Valley, <eol> the big # tech companies fish <eob> xxxx <eob> essentially the same small pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eob> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eob> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who lives, works, <eol> wakes xx and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision to go <eob> there's a desire to give # people autonomy <eob> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless xxxxxx in a role <eol> where # specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eol> their windows, <eol> the <eob> food they want to eat, <eob> you can # choose when there's <eol> music <eol> and when there's <eob>
You xxx choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eol>
You # can save the time you'd spend commuting <eob> and <eob> put <eol> it into <eol> that are important to you. <eol>
A distributed workforce <eob> is # ideal for a technology company. <eob>
people often ask me, <eob> "This works great for <eob> y'all, but what about everyone else?" <eol> If you have an office, <eob> you can do a few things to build distributed xxxxxxxxxxx
First: <eob> document everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eob> to make decisions in the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the hall. <eob>
if people work and some members of the team <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, <eol> they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why.
Always leave x trail of you were and what you were thinking # about. <eob>
This allows others to pick up <eob> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different <eob> time zones to <eob> it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization <eob> evolves, <eob> people leaving and <eol> people joining.
Try # to # have as much communication <eol> as xxxxxxxx online. <eob>
everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the <eol> right tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, <eol> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # that changed how <eol> probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your computer.
So experiment with different <eol> tools that <eob> enable <eol> see what works. <eol>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eol>
In a office, <eob> you're in the <eob> same place <eol> 48 weeks out of the year and you might have <eol> three four weeks apart. <eob>
We xxx to # that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once a # year we do a grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play. <eol>
The primary goal # is connecting people. <eob> We want to <eob> make <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues. <eol>
When they work together <eob> the rest of the year, they # can bring together <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eol>
Every person Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can put towards a co-working xxxxx or just to # buy coffee, <eol> so don't <eol> get xxxxxx <eob> out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eob> decided to pool their stipends together <eol> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they can xxxxxx <eol> in getting the right monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eol> the most productive environment for xxxxx <eob>
Today, there are xxxx a few companies <eob> that are distributed first. <eol>
In a decade or xxxx I predict that 90 <eob> percent companies <eob> that are to <eol> be changing <eol> the course of the world <eob> going xx function this # way. <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eol>
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eob> how you can tap <eol> into global talent, <eob> xxxx people autonomy to live and work <eob> where # they feel they should and still # participate fully in whatever <eol> is that you're creating together. <eob>
