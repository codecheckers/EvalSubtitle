xxxxxx xxx must answer xxx question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
xxxxx transformational # teams <eol> combine ambitions <eol> to their xxxxxxx to their xxxxxxxx <eob> and they # develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>

I # work with x <eob> remarkable # <eob>
xxx name is # Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
xxxx is # health <eol> care <eob>
And # xxxx Nuna # founded, <eol> they # used data to serve xxx health <eol> xxxxx <eol> xx xxxx of workers xx large <eob>
xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, <eol> the issued a proposal <eob> to build the <eol> # first # ever cloud database for # Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> xxxx # Medicaid # xx # program <eob> serves xx # million # Americans, <eob> our poor, # our children <eob> and # disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the # <eol> time was xxxx people <eob> xxx this database <eol> to built in year, <eol> they xxx a whole set of <eol> that had to # honor, and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eol> very much the xxxxxxxx <eob>
This was x # bet-your-company # moment, <eob> and # Jini xxxxxx it. <eob>
xxxxxx # at # opportunity. She # did flinch. <eol>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's # younger brother Kimong # xxx # xxxxxxx <eol>
xxx when # he seven, <eob> xx had # first grand xxx xxxxxxx <eob> Disneyland.
He the ground. <eol> stopped breathing. <eob>
xxxxxx # parents are Korean <eob>
xxxx came to # the # country <eol> with limited <eol> # resources <eob> speaking xxxxxx # English, <eob> so it was # up to Jini <eol> her family xxxxxxxxx
She was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
That xxxxxx defined # # <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> and that mission became her xxxxxxxx <eob> # that company bid on, # won <eol> and on that # <eob>
Here's # to tell # you why. <eob>
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my xxxxxx from today # it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>
Nuna is xxxx letter Medicaid. <eob>
Every row # of # data is a # life <eob> xxxxx <eob> story xxxxxxxx <eob> to be # told with dignity. <eol>
# And Jini's story tells xx <eob> that a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's # <eol> xx xxxx to xxxx # accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eob> xxxx # are inspiring, <eol> xxx # they're # x of vaccine <eol> against # # thinking. <eol>
You think a # rockstar <eol> would # be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives Key Results, <eob> years, xxxx has used OKRs <eob> xx wage x global xxx <eol> against xxxxxxx and disease, and xxx organization <eob> focused # on two xxxxxx # gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first xx debt relief <eob> for the xxxxxxx countries the world. <eob>
# next xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> anti-HIV # drugs. <eob>
Now, # why xxx these good objectives? <eob>
Let's xx # back to our checklist. <eob>

<eob>
xxxxx # let's # just # Bono. <eob>

What # is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners.
There is # x stereotype history <eol> should <eob> be focused on xxx # rulers, <eob> like Lenin Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people in xxxx # <eob> # like mine, Russia, <eob> look # at xx something <eol> xxx # predetermined <eob> xx # determined by the leaders, and common people # xxxxx <eol> influence # any <eob>
Many xxxxxxxx today do # <eob> believe <eol> xxxx Russia # could <eol> ever <eol> or # # will be # a truly democratic # nation, and xxxx xxx way <eol> history has been framed xx the xxxxxxxx # of Russia. <eob>
And this is xxx # true. <eob>
xx # prove it, I spent years <eob> of my life xxxxxx to go xxx # years xxxxx <eob> to # the xxxx 1917, <eob> the year the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx

So any user our website or application <eob> can follow x news feed <eol> for each day xx xxxx <eob> and # <eob> read xxxx <eol> like Stravinsky or Lenin xx Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx and felt. <eol>
We # # all # those personalities <eol> being # like me, not demigods, <eob> and we # see that history xxxxxxxx <eol> # their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx not only their xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
project was # xxxxx xxx xxxx <eob> who xxxx to think that # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # always been an empire <eob> and # ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could # have <eob> just because democracy <eob> was xxx <eob> our destiny. <eob>
But # if # take xxxxxxx look, <eob> it's not that black and xxxxxx <eob>
1917 led <eob> # 70 years <eol> of communist xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this project, # we # xxx Russia <eol> could have # had xxxxxxxxx # history <eob> xxx # <eob> a # <eol> xx any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading # the posts 1917, <eob> you learn Russia <eol> was the # first country # world <eob> to # abolish the death # <eob> or # xxx # of xxx first ones <eol> xx <eol> xxxxx # women voting # <eob>
Knowing history and # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> ordinary influenced # <eob> can # help us # x better xxxxxxx <eob> because history just a <eol> of what's happening xxxxx now. <eob>
xx do xxxx xxx # ways of telling # <eob> and this for example, <eol> we started # a xxx # online project <eol> xxxx is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> that # that gives an <eol> of that xxxxx xxxxx <eob> a xxxx # xxxxxx by xxxxxx social <eob> that, xx # many ways, <eol> created the as we know xx <eob>
But we are # that history alive <eob> by what xx all main <eob> characters use # mobile phones xxx <eob> just # like that? <eob>
And # xx # see xxxx a lot xx individuals <eob> xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the xxxxxxx <eob> no # matter # if they xxxxx <eol> in xxx US # in # USSR <eob> or xxxxxx or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By # exposing history <eob> in xxxx # a democratic # way, <eol> through xxxxxx media, <eob> we show xxxx people power are not xxx only # making choices.

Today, however, <eol> we xxxxx # face # massive challenges <eob> in detecting and xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # illnesses, <eob> such # as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of xxxxxxxx every xxxx <eob> lose their lives <eol> due xx # liver and # cancer. <eob>
Our best way xx <eol> # help these patients <eob> is # # perform early <eol> and diagnoses xxxxx <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases <eol> xxx can artificial intelligence xxxxx <eob>
xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx # # diseases, <eob> an xxxxxxxxx first xxxxxx <eob> very expensive <eol> xxxxxxx # imaging technologies as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx to be xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxx then <eol> those images and talks to # the patient. <eob>
As you xxx xxxx this is <eol> a very resource-intensive <eol> requiring <eol> xxxx # expert physicians, xxxxxxxxx # xxxxxxx # technologies, <eob> and is xxx considered practical <eol> for xxx developing <eob>
And in fact, in # many <eol> industrialized # nations, as <eob>
So, we this problem <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence <eob> xx <eob> # solve this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eol> x repeat, on xx order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very medical xx # generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx # then go <eol> # expert physician, <eob> would xxxx <eol> those images xxx xxx <eol>
And those two pieces of # information, <eob> x # can train xxxx neural network <eol> xx x xxxx learning network <eob> to provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis. <eob>
Similar xx the # first # approach, <eob> traditional xxxxxxxxxx <eol> intelligence approaches xxxxxx from the same xxxxxxxx <eob>
Large of expert physicians xxx expert medical imaging # <eob>
So, # can we <eob> invent xxxx scalable, effective <eob> and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence <eol> architectures <eob> to solve # these xxxx important <eol> problems # facing us xxxxxx <eob>
And this is xxxxxxx <eol> what my # group at MIT Media Lab does. <eol>
We have invented # a <eol> of AI # <eob> architectures <eob> to # solve some of the most important <eol> us today <eob> in <eob> xxxxxxx # # and clinical trials. <eob>
In xxxxxxx shared <eol> xxxx # you # had two goals. <eol>
xxx first goal # xx <eol> the <eob> # of <eob> to train <eol> artificial xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we <eob> xxxxxx <eol> of # technologies <eol> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how # xxx we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of xxxxxxxx <eol> with tens xxx thousands xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx <eol> # traditional AI, <eol> we started # with # single medical image. <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way <eol> xx # extract # billions <eol> of information <eob>
These <eol> # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease <eol> on the
In a sense, # we converted # one xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, <eob> massively reducing xxx amount of <eol> needed # for training. <eob>
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> we started with a # standard, <eol> xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either <eol> from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile # xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eol> the # medical onto this image, creating something <eol> we a # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> # 50 -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- <eob> xx xxxxx # composite to <eol> to xxxx efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of 10,000 <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train the AI algorithms <eol> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using only 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> acquired from # cameras <eol> and mobile <eol> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, our algorithms # can accept, in the and even <eol> some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx <eol> the patient, <eob> instead of expensive <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era <eob> xxxxx # intelligence <eol> is going xx make # incredible <eol> on <eob> our xxxxxxx <eob>
And think that # thinking xxxxxxxxxxx # <eob> which # is data-rich but # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> should # also continue thinking unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eol> xxxxx xxx accept small xxxxxxx of data <eob> and solve some # <eob> of xxx most important <eol> problems facing # today, <eob> especially in # # care.

discovered a xxxxxxxx <eol> of # immune cell, <eob> the T xxxxx <eob> was <eol> that material that x xxxxxxxxx <eob> and # absolutely for wound <eob> healing. <eob>
Now, # just # when xxx were # a kid <eob> xxx you'd break your pencil xxx # tape <eob> back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eob> but it might not be <eol> in # most functional way, <eob> xxx we'll a scar. <eob>
# if we xxxxx have these helper T xxxxxx instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, <eob> xxx develops <eob> fat cells xxxxxx # of # <eob> xxx if there's # fat our muscle, <eol> it isn't xx # <eol>
Now, using our immune system, <eob> our # xxxx grow # <eol> xxxxxxx # these scars <eob> look # # what # it <eol> we were # even injured. <eob>
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create <eob> that # give us the signals <eol> # <eob> by changing the response. <eob>
We xxxx that # x # xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx in xxxxx <eob> xxx xxxxxx system will # to # it. <eob>
This # ranges # xxxx # pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> the xxxxxxxxx that # engineers are using <eol> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xx when I place that # material, <eob> scaffold, in # the <eob> the xxxxxx # system <eol> x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eob> that xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave. <eob>
Now, # just like # xxx <eol> # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eol> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # and # <eol> entire # xx show # on Netflix, <eob> the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop. <eob>
xx we have the xxxxx signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we fat cells instead of xxxxxxx <eob>
These # scaffolds made <eol> of a variety different things, <eob> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eol> derived materials, <eol> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges # that xxx # more or less # porous, <eob> xxxx # of different stiffnesses. <eob>
xxx # <eol> can even make the materials <eol> xxxxxxx # different signals xxxx time.
So in other # words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> this Broadway of cells by them # xxx <eol> stage, xxxx # <eob> that # xxx be <eob> changed for # different xxxxxxxx <eob> just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set for # "Les # <eol> "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx specific types of signals <eob> that how # our # body responds to <eol> to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eob> xx even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we # aren't xxxxx to up <eol> xxx <eob> heal xxxx Wolverine. <eob>
xxxxxxxx not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with xxxxx advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx with # our immune <eob> xxxxxx <eol> help # tissue xxx heal wounds, <eob> we could xxxxx seeing <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx market <eob> that # # body's defense system <eol> help us regenerate, <eob> maybe # xxx xxx xx able <eol> xx # keep # xxxx a xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

xxxxx it's # # way illustrating <eol> xxxxxxx to xx the most change <eob> that is # # of working today. <eol>

But the # is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> are we xxxxxxx to xxxx # <eob>
A few # ago, # I was working a bank <eob> that <eob> to embark <eob> on a transformation. <eob>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, more intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm # not sure how many of you have # # <eol> from # the # inside, so let me # try # to # illustrate <eol> what many xxxxx look xxxxx <eob>
# of # people xx xxxxx <eob> xxxxxx elevators go xx # their department, # marketers, <eol> engineers xxxx engineers, # <eob>
You see xxxxxxxx with <eob> xxxxx xxxxxxx gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
Great xxxx end up <eol> in # PowerPoint # parking lots. <eob>
And there are <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting done forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew <eol> xxxx in <eol> # xxxxx to <eob> they would have # to improve <eol> their time to xxxxxx <eob> by drastically changing <eol> working xx <eob>
But how? <eol>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> to xx and have # a <eol> look at <eob> xxxx seem to # more innovative, <eob> like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos. <eob>
I remember how we were walking <eob> halls at # xxx # of <eol> in 2014, <eob> a # management <eol> and a of bankers. <eob>
We felt # strangers in # land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx and lots xx smart, # employees. <eob>
So then xx asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange xxxx # names like xxxxxxxx <eol> and and "tribes" to # explain # how <eob> they xxxx organized. <eob>
So then we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx <eob>
We # "How many <eol> are working xxx you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
xxxx you report to?" <eob> "It <eob>
xxxx decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
# can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought <eol> some of basic <eob> of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over the course that <eol> xx gained a # better <eol> understanding xx xxxxx model. <eob>
They believed the # <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
xxxxx teams like <eob>
xxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> and IT engineers in the team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers independently of others the company. <eob>
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
had all skills needed <eol> there xx the team. <eob>
Now, xx end of xxxx day, <eol> we # xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxxx on what xx had learned. <eob>
And # we xxx # started to # <eob> like xxxxx model, <eob> so # we # already # of how <eob> to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eol> a guy xxx had not # xxxx a word all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eol>
But I have for you: <eob> What are you willing to # give xxxx <eol> What were we willing xx give up? <eob>
We xxx have an answer immediately, <eol> xx knew he # right. <eob>
Change is not # only <eob> xxxxx <eol> embracing # the new; xxxx xxxxx giving xx <eol> on some the old as xxxxx <eob>
Now, xxxx xxx # xxxx # five <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxx # over the # xxxxx to change their ways # of # xxxxxxxx <eol>

xxx xxx bank and also <eol> xxx xxx other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> was possible. <eob>
Within a # <eol> year, we completely <eol> xxxx # xx the xxx # silos <eob> between # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, channels xxx IT. <eob>
xxxxx thousand employees xxxx reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So xxxxxxx of # <eol> sitting with # people <eob> and # engineers engineers, <eob> a product xxxxxx xxx an engineer were now members of the same # <eob> xxxxx <eob>
You could be a member <eob> of # a xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx account # xxxxxxx or xxx xxx mobile # banking app, etc. <eob>
At xxx # date <eol> of that organization, <eob> people # xxxx # shaking # hands <eol> for the # # xxxxx time, <eol> only to xxxx out xxxx they xxx <eol> sitting two xxxxxxx away xxxx each other <eob> but # # were each # other emails <eob> and # status reports for the last <eol> 10 # <eob>

# xxxx they're having xxxxxx <eol> together every <eob>

They can xxxxxx to # with customers immediately # <eob> no handovers, xx # PowerPoints, # no red <eob> just # <eol> getting xxxxx done. <eol>
Now, getting there # is # <eol> xxx easy. <eob>
xxx turns # out, <eob> "What <eob> xxx you # willing to # give xxxx <eob> is exactly # xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
Instead xx # decisions going <eol> up and xxxx the organization, <eob> want the <eob> team to # decide.

# <eob> this means xx # cannot leaders <eob> commanding their people what # to xxx <eob> when # xx do, how to xxx <eob>

# it xxxx means # that each employee <eol> needs # to become a leader, <eob> regardless # # their xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's about # all of us xxxxxxxx # up <eol> xx take <eol>
obviously, xx also <eob> xx have all # these teams <eol> # in different directions, <eol> xxxx <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>

xx was # x # # choice from the very xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I don't use xxx # word xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx it up expectation, <eob> that # people # xxx xxxxxxxxx and some aren't. <eob>
I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where # everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eol>
I think # a workforce <eob> is <eob> the # most effective xxx <eol> to build x <eob> # company. <eob>
The key xx # you have to <eob> approach it # <eob>
When # xx started WordPress, many # of # the first 20 xxxxx were I'd never # in person. <eob>
But xxxx collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eob>
I # wanted # to # <eol> continue # that <eol> xxx simple reason. <eob>
I believe that # talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> # world. <eob> But opportunity # not. <eob>
In Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the small <eol> # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eob> can # fish from the entire ocean. <eol>

Everyone xxx have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want # eat, <eob> xxx # choose xxxx # music <eol> and # # # silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx what temperature <eol> the room <eol> xxxxxx # be. <eol>
You can save the xxxx <eol> you'd # spend # commuting and put it xxxx # things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eol> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company. <eob>
But often ask me, <eob> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, <eol> about # everyone xxxxxx <eob> If you xxxx an office, <eob> xxx can do # # things <eol> to distributed capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In xx office, it's easy <eol> to xxxx decisions in the moment, <eob> the kitchen, in the <eob>
if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the <eol> are xxxxx <eob> they don't have access to, <eob> they'll see these decisions being made understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave # <eob> of # you # were <eol> and xxx were about. <eob>
This # <eob> allows others <eob> # # <eol> pick up <eob> where left off.
allows people in different <eol> time zones to xxxxxxxxx also great to # think about <eol> as an organization <eol> people xxxxxxx and people joining.
Try # have # as much # communication <eol> possible xxxxxxx
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx <eol> xx allows new people to catch up xxxxxxxx <eob>
You need to <eob> xxxx the right tools. <eob>
are many xxxx and services <eol> that with # day-to-day communication, <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that # changed <eol> xxx you xxxx <eol> probably aren't # xxxxxxx <eob> # anymore.
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx your # <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> xxxxx collaboration, <eob> see # what <eob> works.
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eol> you're in the # same place <eol> 48 # weeks # out of # the year <eob> and # might <eol> # or # four apart. <eob>
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. <eol> Once a <eob> year xx xxxxx # meet-up <eob> xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx <eol> for week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
xxx goal is # people. <eob> # want to sure <eol> everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> and # have a # deeper connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When work # together <eol> rest of the year, <eob> they together <eob> that # understanding and empathy.
And the xxxxx practice: give people flexibility <eob> to make their xxx <eob> work environment. <eob>
Every person # <eol> a co-working # <eob> xxxx they can put <eol> xxxxxxx # a <eob> or # xxxx to buy coffee, so # xxxxx get kicked # out xx # xxx # coffee # <eol>
One in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a # xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing xxxxx <eob>
Each person who # # <eob> the company <eol> gets a <eob>
This is money they # can invest <eol> in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, <eol> xxx # desk so # xxxx have <eol> the most productive environment xxx them.
xxxxxx there # just a # few companies <eol> that are xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # <eob> xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx that percent of companies <eob> are # # changing <eol> xxx course of the world <eol> are going # to # this # way. <eob>
They will # evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eob> they'll be replaced by those xxxx <eob>
As you # xxxxx about <eol> xxxxx to xxxxx next, consider how xxx can tap into # global talent, <eob> xxxx # people autonomy to live <eol> where they feel they # <eob> should <eob> participate # fully in whatever <eob> it is # xxxx you're creating <eob>
