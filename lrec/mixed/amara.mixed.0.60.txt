Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, waking up to an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eol>
Welcome <eol> to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious <eol> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes. <eob>
This kind of harassment keeps women <eob> from accessing the <eol> internet <eob> -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eol>
Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world, with 140 million people having access <eob> to mobile technologies, <eol> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the rise of new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also the <eol> birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai.
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eol> the twisted <eol> concept of honor <eob> is linked to women and their bodies; <eob> where men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> and even kill <eol> them sometimes <eob> in <eob> the name of so-called "family honor"; <eol> where women are <eol> left to <eob> die <eob> right outside their houses <eol> for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me <eob> say this very clearly: <eol> it's not honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded <eol> murder.
I come from a very <eol> small village <eob> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eob> didn't <eob> allow their women <eol> to <eob> pursue their higher education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, my father was one who really supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of disapproval. <eob>
But in the <eob> end, I <eob> knew it's either me <eol> or them, <eol> and I chose myself.
(Applause)
My <eob> family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to <eol> own a mobile <eol> phone until I was <eob> married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eob> this tool became a <eol> tool <eob> for my own surveillance. <eol>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this <eob> and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our Constitution? <eol>
While the <eob> law states that a woman <eol> has the same equal access <eol> to the information, <eob> why is it always <eol> men -- brothers, <eob> fathers and husbands -- <eol> who are granting these rights to us, effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to take a step, <eob> instead of keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal structures <eol> and societal norms. <eob>
And I founded the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the issues <eol> and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment.
From lobbying for free and safe <eob> internet <eob> to convincing young women <eol> that access to the safe internet <eob> is their fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to play my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the questions <eob> that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With a hope in my heart, <eob> and to <eol> offer a solution to this menace, <eol> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eol> in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the women <eol> who do not know who <eob> to turn to when they face <eob> serious threats online. <eob>
I think of the women who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe <eol> in online spaces, <eob> and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the internet <eol> is an access to knowledge, <eol> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I <eob> fight for women's digital rights, <eol> I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
Why?
In some cases, it's because they're bad <eol> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eob> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
And this is unacceptable.
This has to stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going <eol> to choose the right course? <eob>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For years, I've worked with talented teams and they've chosen the right <eob> objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eob> others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to share with you what <eob> really makes a difference -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eob> how and why <eob> they set meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to 1975. <eob>
Yep, this is me. <eob>
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest manager <eol> of his or <eob> any other era.
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you know. <eol>
Execution is what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and Key Results".
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eol>
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management by objective systems <eob> are the objectives <eob> and the key results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction. <eob>
The key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can look <eob> and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I do <eob> that, or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eol> or OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, <eol> they work for teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the <eob> truth: <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eob> and most of us <eol> are not setting goals <eob> at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their numbers, <eob> but they lack a <eol> sense of purpose <eob> to inspire their teams. <eol>
So how do you set <eob> these goals the right way? <eob>
First, you must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" <eob> Why? <eol>
Because truly transformational teams <eol> combine <eob> their ambitions <eob> to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name is Jini <eol> Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eol>
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, they used data to serve the health needs of <eob> lots of workers at large companies.
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, the federal government issued a <eob> proposal <eol> to build the first ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll <eob> remember <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million <eol> Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time was <eob> just 15 people <eob> and this database <eob> had to be built in <eob> one year, <eob> and they had a whole set of commitments <eob> that they had to honor, <eol> and frankly, they weren't going <eol> to make <eol> very much money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the <eob> opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a <eob> personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when he was seven, <eob> he had his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eol>
He fell to the ground. <eob> He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the country with limited resources speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine years old. <eol>
That moment defined her <eob> mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eol> and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract. <eol>
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from bankruptcy, and today it provides for Kimong's health and for millions of others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is a life <eob> whose story deserves to be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to <eob> have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are significant, <eol> they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, <eol> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a <eob> rockstar <eob> would be <eol> an unlikely user of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono has <eol> used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for the <eob> poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good objectives? <eol>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just <eob> listen to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eol>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> lead you to <eob> do?
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eol> then your passion means nothing. <eol>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it. <eob>
It gives us an environment for risk, <eob> for trust, where <eob> failing is not a fireable offense. <eol>
And when you have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eol> and the right people, <eol> magic is around the corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eob> with Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eol>
Let's turn our attention to the <eol> hows. <eol>
Remember, the hows are the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and <eob> time-bound.
They're aggressive but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eob> and they're verifiable.
Those <eob> are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eob> to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they are, <eob> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not quite. <eol>
What <eob> he really said was, <eob> "We don't have any other way <eol> to manage this company, <eol> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I took that as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> her objectives and her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them <eob> for <eol> everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eol>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're used <eol> for a higher purpose, and that's to get collective <eob> commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a Googler, <eob> Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> for the future of web applications -- in other words, build the best browser. <eob>
He was very thoughtful <eob> about how he chose his key <eol> results. <eob>
How <eob> do you measure the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or <eol> engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had this one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eol>
And then every year he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10.
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eol>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third year, he upped the <eol> ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an <eob> aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this <eob> story, <eob> not so much for the happy ending, <eol> but it shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it <eob> year after year after year. <eol>
It's a perfect <eol> story for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows <eob> of our ambitions. <eol>
What really matters is the <eob> why <eol> that we pour into those vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eob> a substitute for a strong culture or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those fundamentals are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I want you to think about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics?
Take time to <eob> write down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eol> you can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, <eob> of Google, they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, high-quality for everyone, ending global poverty, access to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered today by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've been called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading the good <eol> gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's <eob> fight <eol> for what it is <eol> that <eob> really matters, <eob> because we can take OKRs <eol> beyond our businesses. <eol>
We can take them to our families, <eol> to our schools, even to our governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eob>
We can transform those informations.
We can get back on the right track <eob> if we <eob> can and do measure <eob> what really matters. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause)
What is history?
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eol> or determined by the leaders, <eob> and common people could not <eob> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been <eob> or ever will be a <eob> truly <eol> democratic nation, <eol> and this is due to the way <eol> history has been <eob> framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, to the year 1917, <eob> the year of the Russian Revolution.
I asked myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we built a social network for dead people, <eol> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people <eol> 100 years ago. <eob>
So <eol> any user of our website or application <eob> can follow a news feed for each day of 1917 and read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eob> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like you and me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eob> not <eol> only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project <eob> was a shock for many Russians, <eob> who used to think that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have <eob> prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eob> was not our <eob> destiny. <eol>
But if we take a broader look, <eol> it's not that black and white. <eol>
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eol>
But with this project, <eob> we see that Russia could have had a different history <eol> and a democratic future, <eol> as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eol> you learn that Russia <eob> was the first country in the world <eob> to abolish <eob> the death penalty, or one of the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can help us create a better future, <eob> because history <eob> is just a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening <eob> right now. <eol>
We do <eol> need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this year, for example, <eob> we started a new online project that is called 1968Digital.com, and that is an online documentary series that gives <eob> you an impression of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by global social change <eob> that, in <eob> many ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now. <eob>
But we are making that history alive by imagining what if all the main <eob> characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eol>
And we see that <eob> a lot of individuals were facing the same challenges <eob> and were fighting for the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eob> in the US or in <eob> USSR <eob> or in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia.
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people in power <eob> are not the only ones making choices. <eob>
That gives any user <eob> a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter.
Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eob>
We <eob> all make history. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause)
Computer algorithms today <eob> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using human-like <eob> intelligence. <eob>
And this intelligence of computers <eol> is often referred to as AI <eob> or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI is poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on our lives in the future.
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases and cancer.
Thousands of patients every year <eob> lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our best <eob> way to help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases. <eob>
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help? <eol>
In patients who, unfortunately, are suspected of these diseases, <eob> an expert physician <eob> first orders <eob> very expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eol> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the patient.
As you <eob> can <eob> see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eol> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, <eob> and is not considered practical for the developing world. <eob>
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized nations, as <eob> well. <eob>
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using artificial intelligence? <eol>
Today, if I were <eol> to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eol> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I <eol> repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical images <eob> first to be <eob> generated. <eob>
After that, I would then go <eol> to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze those images for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, <eob> I can train a standard deep neural <eob> network <eol> or a deep learning network <eob> to <eob> provide patient's diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large amounts of data, expert physicians <eob> and expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we <eol> invent more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing us today?
And this is exactly <eob> what my group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures <eob> to solve some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials. <eob>
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal was to reduce the number of images <eob> required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms.
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> we wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So how did we <eob> do it? <eob>
For our first <eob> goal, <eob> instead of starting with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive <eol> medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eol>
From this <eob> image, my team and I <eol> figured out a very clever way <eol> to extract billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These information packets <eol> included colors, pixels, geometry and rendering of <eob> the disease <eob> on the medical image. <eob>
In a sense, we converted one image into billions of training data points, <eol> massively reducing the amount of data <eol> needed for training. <eol>
For our second goal, to reduce the use of expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to <eol> screen patients, <eob> we started with a <eob> standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eol> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eob> or a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then <eol> remember those billions of information <eob> packets?
We overlaid those from <eob> the <eol> medical image onto this image, creating something <eol> that we call a composite <eob> image. <eob>
Much to our surprise, <eob> we only required 50 -- <eob> I <eob> repeat, only 50 -- of these composite images to train <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eol> instead of using 10,000 <eob> very expensive medical images, we can now train the AI algorithms <eol> in an unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 of these high-resolution, but standard <eob> photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, white light photographs from the <eob> patient, instead of expensive medical imaging technologies.
I believe that we are poised <eol> to enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence <eol> is <eob> going to make an incredible impact on our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking about traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we should also continue thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eol> which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important problems facing us today, especially in <eob> health care.
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if <eob> you could take a pill or a vaccine <eol> and, just like getting over a <eol> cold, <eob> you could heal your wounds <eol> faster?
Today, if <eol> we have <eol> an operation or an accident, <eob> we're in the <eob> hospital for weeks, <eol> and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects <eob> of our inability to regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs.
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eol> to build tissues <eol> and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing <eob> body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eol> that can achieve <eob> this feat. <eol>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eob> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eol>
To make this magic <eob> a bit closer to reality, <eol> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions from the immune <eol> system.
From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection, <eol> our immune system defends <eol> our body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eol> in our <eob> fight to <eob> build back <eol> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eob> that are currently <eob> being tested for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eol> our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured muscle with these materials, <eob> there was a large number of immune cells in that material <eol> and the <eob> surrounding muscle.
So <eob> in this case, instead of the immune cells rushing off <eol> towards infection to fight bacteria, <eol> they're rushing toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific type of immune cell, the helper T cell, was present inside <eob> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and you'd break your pencil and try and tape it back together again, we can heal, <eob> but it might not be <eob> in the most functional way, <eob> and we'll get a scar. <eol>
So if we don't have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eol> our muscle <eob> develops <eob> fat cells inside of it, <eol> and if there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back <eol> without <eol> these scars <eob> and look like what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that any time a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eob> to the materials that engineers are using <eol> to try and build new tissue. <eol>
So when I place <eob> that material, <eol> or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune <eob> system creates <eol> a small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can change the way that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> affects our daily activities, <eol> like going <eob> for a run <eob> or <eob> staying inside and binge-watching <eol> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment of a scaffold affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the <eob> wrong signals, <eol> say the Netflix signals, <eol> we get fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eol> of a variety of different things, <eob> from plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less porous, <eol> gels of different stiffnesses.
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed for different tissues, <eol> just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus <eob> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific <eob> types of signals that mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eol> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going to <eob> wake up tomorrow <eol> and <eol> be able to <eob> heal <eob> like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either.
But with these advances, <eol> and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal wounds, <eob> we <eob> could begin seeing <eob> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system to help us regenerate, <eol> and maybe one day be able <eol> to keep pace with a salamander. <eol>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On <eob> hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eol> and stick my face in front of <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, was a privileged one in our community. <eol>
Growing up, stories <eol> of next-door neighbors <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy <eob> seemed normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eol> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eol> after <eob> their heat was shut off, <eol> just to keep their family comfortable for one <eob> more day. <eob>
These kinds of dangerous <eol> incidents can take <eob> root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the US, the average American spends three percent of their income on energy.
In contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations can spend 20, even 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eob> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide power to their homes.
This is when energy becomes a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are so much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your <eol> child to get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her?
Or do you keep her warm? <eol>
It's an <eob> impossible choice, and nearly every month, <eol> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eol>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are <eob> disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more per <eob> square foot <eob> than their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans <eol> and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into <eol> the mass <eol> of 37 million people a year who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma. <eol>
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eob> and our pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have the tools to address <eol> these systemic <eob> inequities. <eol>
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are <eob> all decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we approach cost parity, the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American. <eol>
This is why, when I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit <eob> RETI.
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities, <eob> utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eob> to clean energy, energy efficiency and energy technology.
But there's no one way <eob> to solve this. <eol>
I believe in the power <eol> of local communities, <eob> in the transforming <eob> effect <eob> of relationships.
So we start by working <eob> directly <eol> with the communities <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops and events for communities <eol> to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation for windows and water heaters can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eob> to <eob> community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research and installation programs <eob> to help families bring down their energy bills. <eol>
We're even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, because to see this vision <eol> of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eob> we have to <eol> work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US spends <eob> over three billion a year <eol> on energy <eob> bill payment <eob> assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, <eol> but they're only able to help <eob> a fraction of those in need.
In fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not sustainable. <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our <eol> communities, we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable.
At scale, microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy efficiency <eol> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eol> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income <eob> who's struggling to make ends meet. <eob>
This is life-changing.
This is an opportunity <eob> for families <eol> to use their energy savings to sponsor their future.
I think back to my great-grandmother and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eob> that they had to make <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on our whole community. <eob>
But this is not just about them. <eob>
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible choices today.
And I know high energy <eol> burdens <eob> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eol> but through relationships <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will <eob> all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
Have you ever watched <eol> a flock of birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eol> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eob> would simply be too low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe that these birds <eol> are aligned on a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird to make autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eol>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast <eol> and flexible.
Now, what does this have to do with any one of us? <eob>
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the most important change that is needed in <eob> ways of working today. <eol>
The world is getting faster and more complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that <eol> creates <eob> alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster.
But the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give up? <eol>
A few years ago, I was working with a bank <eol> that <eol> wanted to embark <eol> on a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted <eol> their <eob> offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen a bank from the inside, so let me try to illustrate <eob> what many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits taking elevators to go <eol> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with 20 people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eol>
Great <eob> ideas? They end up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eol>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever. <eol>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eol> they would have to improve <eol> their time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eob> their ways of working as <eob> well. <eob>
But how?
To get some inspiration, we decided to go and have a look at companies <eob> that seem to be more innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember <eol> how we were walking <eol> the halls at one of these companies in December 2014, a <eob> management consultant and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt like strangers <eob> in a strange land, <eol> surrounded <eob> by beanbags and hoodies and lots of smart, creative employees. <eol>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eol> And we expected to get an <eol> org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings with funny names like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" <eol> and "tribes" to explain how they were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to translate <eob> that to <eol> our own world.
We asked, "How many people <eob> are working for you?" <eol> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report <eol> to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for what we thought <eob> were some of the basic principles of organizations, <eol> and their answer was, "It depends".
Now, over the course of that day, we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model.
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT <eol> engineers in the same team <eob> so they <eob> could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eol> independently of others in the company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
They had all the skills needed <eob> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, <eob> at the end of that day, <eob> we had a session <eol> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started <eol> to like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how <eol> to apply some of these ideas to a <eol> bank. <eol>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all day, <eob> he suddenly said, "So I see you like our model. <eol>
But I have one question for you: What <eob> are you willing to give up?" <eob> What <eob> were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eol>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> on some of the old as well. <eob>
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I <eob> have worked with <eol> companies <eob> all over the world <eob> to change <eob> their ways of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has their own skeptics <eob> about why this is not <eol> going to work for them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> or "They don't have <eob> the legacy IT like we do," <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this in our industry". <eol>
But for this bank and <eob> also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we completely blew <eol> up <eol> the old silos between marketing, product, channels and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees were reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eol>
So instead of product people <eob> sitting just with product people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eol> a product person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same <eol> team. <eol>
You could <eol> be a member of a team responsible for account opening or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date of that new organization, some people were shaking hands <eob> for the very first time, only to find out that they had been sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 <eob> years.
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing for <eob> answers". <eob> (Laughter)
But now, they're having coffee together every day. <eol>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it to get input from <eob> the engineer <eol> who is sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just getting stuff <eob> done. <eol>
Now, getting there <eol> is not easy. <eob>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eol> is exactly the right question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and down <eob> the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to <eob> do so, we need all the skills and expertise for that decision <eol> in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different countries today? <eob>
Or <eob> should we invest in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do things across these teams? <eob>
We still need <eol> some kind <eob> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes to structure <eol> and process and procedure -- <eol> they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our <eol> own behavior.
Let me try to illustrate.
If we want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, they have <eob> to be <eol> empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders <eob> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when <eol> to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But it also means that each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eol>
It's about <eob> all of us <eob> stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all these teams <eol> running in different directions, because that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos.
So we need alignment and autonomy <eob> at the same <eob> time, <eob> just like a flock of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new <eob> behavior, <eob> there is giving <eob> up on <eob> something old as well. <eol>
Leaders <eol> have to make sure <eol> that everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall <eol> priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go <eob> and trust their teams to make the right decisions on how to get there. <eol>
Now, creating alignment requires open and <eob> transparent communication. <eob>
But you know how they say <eol> that information is <eol> a source of power? <eol>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eol>
And it's not <eol> just managers. <eob>
The teams <eob> need to communicate openly and <eob> transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically <eol> work in short sprints, and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session to share the <eob> output <eol> of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eol> each <eol> member of the team gives an update <eob> of what they are <eob> working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is transparent for everyone. <eol>
So, alignment is not easy, <eol> and providing autonomy <eob> is not so obvious, either.
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain <eol> how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking.
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eol> instead of looking at status reports, <eol> he needs to walk down to <eob> the team floors to attend one of their sessions.
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help <eob> them. <eol>
That is radical change for someone <eob> who used <eob> to be <eob> a master of milestone-tracking.
But in the old world, this executive said, <eol> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run over time and over budget, anyway.
Now I have much more transparency, <eob> and I can course-correct much earlier if needed". <eob>
And middle managers need to change as well. <eob>
First <eol> of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the old world, there was this idea of thinkers and <eob> doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eol> managing other <eol> people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eob> to become <eob> player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the last <eob> 10 years, <eol> you have just been telling <eol> other people what to do, <eob> but now you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great people leave the company. <eob>
But the result is a new culture with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this is hard work. <eol>
But it's worth it.
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per year. <eob>
Now they have releases every <eob> few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eob> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization becomes more efficient.
And <eob> finally, if you walk the halls of <eol> these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking the <eob> halls <eob> of a very large start-up. <eol>
Now, to be fair, these <eob> companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eol>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eol>
And the hardest part of <eob> that change <eob> is not in structure <eob> or process or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eob> senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of those in the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
A leader is <eob> steady, firm, <eob> decisive, unwavering. <eol>
Never let 'em see you <eob> sweat, <eol> always have an answer. <eob>
[The Way We Work] My name is Dan, <eob> I'm a partner <eol> at a global creative consultancy.
But there's <eob> another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, the character I created on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought about my double life, <eol> I couldn't help <eob> but wonder ... <eob>
When your true self <eol> is a little nontraditional, <eol> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to the office? <eol>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the <eob> first 10 years of my career, <eob> I thought there was <eol> one way to be a leader: <eol> decisive and serious.
But that's not me. <eol>
So I'd put on basically <eol> office drag to fit the role: I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eob> try to hold in my <eob> hand motions. <eob>
I'm someone who gets <eol> really excited about things, <eol> so I'd temper that. <eob>
I had <eob> this little voice <eol> in my head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too <eob> feminine, too flamboyant".
I had one well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eob> "Everyone knows you're gay. And that's great. <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I dressed up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eob> thinking my friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eol>
And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The post went viral, <eol> and at first it <eob> was pure fun. <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages from <eol> people <eob> about how happy it made them, <eob> how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eol>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell that <eol> little voice in my head to just shut up <eob> and let myself be <eol> me.
But then things got a little too big.
Carrie Dragshaw <eob> was everywhere -- In the "New <eol> York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eob> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eol>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I thought I was <eol> going to have to <eol> get a different job.
But then, something happened, something small.
I got a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, it just said, <eol> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me.
And it let me put that little, scared voice away <eob> and just be excited <eol> about this whole new world, rather than freaked out.
That's the power of one person, sometimes all it takes is one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eob>
They became more open, <eob> more playful with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eob> gave them permission <eol> to <eob> be more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eob> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eol>
But it's done the opposite.
Two years in, <eob> I never could have imagined that this <eol> part of me would not just <eol> be embraced, <eob> but could actually help my <eol> career. <eob>
Now, I'm lucky. <eol>
I work in <eol> New York City, <eol> in an office where creativity is valued and <eol> I was already pretty established <eol> in my career when <eol> all of this started. <eol>
Maybe that's you, maybe <eob> it isn't. <eol>
But all of this has taught me so much <eob> about just the importance of bringing your whole self to work. <eol>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eob> about what <eob> it takes to be successful.
There's no one kind of way to be a leader. <eob>
It's about <eob> finding your strengths <eol> and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was <eob> hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect leader mask.
Now, I can say, <eol> "Gosh, that was frustrating". <eob>
We can talk about challenges and <eob> struggles in an open way, <eob> rather than everybody pretending <eol> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eol>
Think of all the wasted <eol> energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to me, though, <eol> is that in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eol> also believe their organization values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eol> and all of our strange inner voices <eol> have <eob> a <eol> long way to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big difference <eol> between adapting <eob> and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned <eob> that a little late. <eob>
Personally, <eob> I'm taking all of this <eob> as a call to be the ally who, like my boss did for me, <eol> lets people know that it's OK to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> or have a disability <eob> or are deeply religious, <eob> see what it's like <eob> being your full self <eob> at <eol> work. <eob>
You might be <eol> pleasantly surprised.
The basic problem <eol> with working in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work environment.
[The Way We Work] <eob> Howdy, my name is Matt, <eol> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, <eob> the company behind WordPress.com, <eol> Jetpack and WooCommerce. <eob>
We're coming up on over <eol> 800 employees, and they live everywhere, <eob> from California to Alabama, Mississippi, <eob> to where I live in Texas.
They're <eol> also in 67 countries. <eol>
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eob>
Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a home <eob> base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether they are in RVs <eol> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eol> they are in new places <eol> every day, week or month.
As long as they <eob> can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> from the very beginning. <eol>
Notice I don't use the word "remote," <eob> because it sets up the <eob> expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eob> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think a <eol> distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way to build a company. <eob>
The key is you have <eob> to <eob> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eol> many of the first 20 hires were people <eob> I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eol>
I <eob> wanted to continue that for one simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, the big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the <eob> same small <eol> pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire <eol> ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, you can gain someone who lives, works, wakes up and goes to sleep wherever they are in the world. <eob> They <eol> bring a different <eob> understanding of that culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over how they do their work.
Unless you're in a role <eol> where <eob> specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eol>
Everyone can <eob> have a corner office, their windows, the food they want to eat, you can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eob> the room <eob> should <eol> be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and put <eob> it <eob> into things <eob> that are <eob> important to you. <eob>
A <eob> distributed <eob> workforce <eob> is ideal for a technology company. <eob>
But people often <eob> ask me, "This works great <eob> for y'all, <eol> but what about everyone else?" <eol> If you have an office, <eol> you can do a <eob> few things <eob> to build distributed capability. <eob>
First: document everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the hall.
But if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eol> are having those conversations <eol> they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why.
Always leave a <eol> trail of where you were <eol> and what you were thinking about. <eob>
This <eol> allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different <eol> time zones to interact, it's also great to think about <eob> as an organization evolves, <eob> people leaving and people joining. <eob>
Try to have as much communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new people to catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools.
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management.
The things <eob> that changed how you work <eol> probably aren't objects <eol> anymore. <eol>
They're things you access <eob> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eob> tools <eol> that enable collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional office, you're in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out of the year <eol> and you might have three or four weeks apart. <eob>
We try to flip <eob> that: we come together for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eob>
It's <eob> half-work, half-play.
The primary goal is connecting people. <eol> We want to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eob> and they have a deeper connection <eol> with <eol> their colleagues. <eob>
When they work <eob> together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring <eob> together that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final practice: <eob> give people <eob> the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can <eol> put <eol> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy <eob> coffee, so they don't <eol> get kicked out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eob> decided to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins <eol> the company gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This is money they can invest <eob> in getting <eob> the right chair, monitor, the right <eol> desk setup, so they can <eob> have <eob> the <eob> most productive environment <eol> for them. <eol>
Today, there are just <eob> a few companies <eol> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or two, <eol> I predict that 90 percent of <eob> companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eob> world <eob> are going to function this way. <eol>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or <eob> they'll be <eol> replaced by those that are. <eob>
As <eol> you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, consider how you can tap into global talent, <eob> give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eob> it is that you're creating together.
