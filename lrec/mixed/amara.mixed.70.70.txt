But <eob>
xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> go and have # a # at # companies xxxx # to be <eol> # more innovative, <eob> like Netflix, xxxxxxx

I think # a # xxxxxxxxxxx # workforce <eob> xxx most # way <eol> # x company. <eob>
xxx <eob> key is # you # have # to xxxxxxxx xx # consciously. <eol>
When # started WordPress, <eob> many # xxx first 20 # people I'd never met xxxxxxx <eob>
But # we'd <eol> online, sometimes xxx <eob>
I xxxxxx xx continue that xxx xxx <eob> reason. <eob>

In Valley, <eol> the big xxxx <eob> from essentially <eob> xxx same small # bay. <eob>
A <eol> # distributed company <eol> can fish # from # the entire xxxxxx <eol>

You xxx save the # <eol> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> and # put # it into things xxxx # xxx # # xx xxxx
# xxxxxxxxx is ideal # for # a company. <eob>
But often ask xxxxx works great # for xxxxxx <eob> but xxxx about # else?" <eol> xxx # have an # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # xxx x # few # things <eob> to build capability.
First: document # everything. <eol>
In # an xxxxxxx <eob> # to make # xxxxxxxxx in the xxxxxxx <eob> in in the
if xxxxxx # xxxx # xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx # # xxx <eob> team <eol> xxx having those conversations <eob> they don't have access they'll see <eol> # these # decisions being made without xxxxxxxxxxxxx # why. <eol>
