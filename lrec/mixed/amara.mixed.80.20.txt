Now, # like xxxx a <eol> xxx you'd # xxxxx xxxx xxxxxx <eob> and try and back # together # <eol> xx can # <eob> xxx it xxxxx not xx <eol> # most xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and we'll get a <eob>

Now, xxxxx xxx # immune system, <eob> xxx # xxxxx xxxx # back <eol> these # scars <eob> xxxx like what # xxx <eol> before we # were xxxx <eob>
I'm working # # create <eob> give us xxx signals <eol> # build xxx <eob> xx # the # immune # response. <eob>
We <eob> # any # time <eol> x material xx # implanted # body, <eol> the # immune xxxxxx xxxx respond # it. <eob>
This from pacemakers <eol> xx # pumps <eob> # that # engineers <eob> # xxx using <eol> xx # xxx # new xxxxxxx <eob>
when # that # material, <eol> or # scaffold, in the xxxxx <eob> the # system # <eol> a xxxxx environment # cells and xxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx can way <eol> that xxx # stem xxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Now, just # like xxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # daily # <eob> xxxx xxxxx for a xxx <eob> or xxxxxxx xxx binge-watching <eol> an entire # Netflix, <eob> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx of scaffold <eob> # xxx that <eol> # xxxx # cells # and xxxxxxxx <eob>

xxx this # brings difficult <eob>
we # physically co-locate <eol> who are # working # in xxxxxxxxx buildings, <eob> different # <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today?
xx should xx invest <eol> xx better # <eob>
xxx how # we ensure xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in xxx way # do things <eob> xxxxxx teams?
