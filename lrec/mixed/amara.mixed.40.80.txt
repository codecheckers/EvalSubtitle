Welcome to the world # of cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx of harassment women <eol> face xx # Pakistan is very <eob> and leads to # sometimes deadly <eob>
This kind <eob> of harassment keeps <eob> women accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge.
It's x # form of <eol> oppression.
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx mobile technologies, <eol> and 15 percent penetration. <eob>
And this number # doesn't seem # # go down <eol> with xxx rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan <eol> also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eob> Malala <eob> #
But just xxx of Pakistan. <eob>
Another # aspect is where the twisted xxxxxxx <eob> of <eol> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are to disrespect women and even them xxxxxxxxx in the name of so-called <eol> "family <eol> where # women are left # die right # outside their houses <eol> for # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx in # xxx name of "family honor". <eol>
# me say very clearly: <eol> it's not honor; <eob> a # murder. <eob>
I come from a xxxx # small village <eol> xx xxxxxxx <eol> Pakistan, <eol> where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
elders of xx family <eob> didn't allow # xxxxx women <eol> to xxxxxx their higher # education <eob> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx # the other <eob> male guardians of my family, <eol> my <eob> father was # who really <eob> supported # my # <eol>
To get law xxxxxxx of course, # really difficult, <eob> and [there frowns of disapproval.
xxx the end, I xxxx it's either # me or xxxxx and chose myself.
xxxxxxxxxx
xx family's traditions <eol> and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't <eob> allow me to a mobile phone until married.
And even when I was married, <eob> this became <eol> a tool <eol> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by <eob> my ex-husband, <eob> he <eob> # really didn't approve of this <eol> and # threw me of xxx house, <eob> xxxxx <eob> my six-month-old <eob> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time <eob> when I xxxxx asked myself,
Why are # women not to enjoy xxx xxxx equal rights enshrined # in our # Constitution? <eob>
While <eob> # xxx xxxxxx # that a woman <eol> has xxx same # <eol> xxxxx xxxxxx the # information, <eob> why is it # always men <eob> xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eol> who # are xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, effectively making # the law <eol> irrelevant?" <eol>
So I decided to # take a step, <eob> instead keep questioning <eob> # patriarchal structures <eol> and <eob> societal norms.
And I the Digital # Rights Foundation # in # 2012 to address all xxx issues <eol> xxx women's experiences in <eob> online spaces <eol> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for <eob> xxxx and safe # internet <eol> convincing young women that access # to the safe internet <eob> is fundamental, <eol> basic, # human <eol> right, <eol> I'm trying # to play part <eol> xx igniting spark <eob> to address <eob> the questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eol>
With <eol> # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's first <eol> cyberharassment help line <eol> in December # 2016 -- <eol>

This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eob> to xxxxxx the right <eob>

For # <eob> years, # I've worked <eol> with talented # teams <eol> and they've chosen xxx right objectives <eol> xxx wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to # share with you <eol> what <eob> really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> xxxxxx what's how and # they xxx <eob> meaningful # audacious goals, <eob> the xxxxx # goals xxx the <eob> right # reasons. <eob>
Let's # go # back # to 1975. <eol>
Yep, # is # me. <eob>
I've got a to xxxxxx <eol> I'm x <eob> computer <eol> I've got long hair, I'm under <eob> # xxxx Grove, <eob> been called the manager <eob> of his # or any xxxxx era. <eob>
Andy <eob> was a leader <eob> xxx also a # teacher, <eol> and he # <eol> # to me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know. <eol>
Execution is <eob> xxxx matters the <eob>
And so # x # xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off <eob> the xxxxxxx doesn't # it? <eol>
And <eob> it's all xxxxxxxxx execution.
So # here's <eob> # # <eob> classic video from 1970s <eol> xx professor Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) # Andy Grove: <eob> # The xxx key # phrases <eob> xx the management by objective <eol> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eob> and they match the two <eob> purposes. <eol>
xxx objective is # the <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The # key results have to measured, <eol> the end you can look <eol> and without xxx argument say, <eob> "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. <eob> Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eol>
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system and they work for organizations, <eob> they work xxx teams, they even work for individuals.
xxx # are <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eol>
The key are # how <eob> I'm going to get # xxxx # done. <eob>
Objectives. Key <eob>
What and # how. <eol>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many xx us are setting # goals wrong, <eol> xxx most us <eol> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eol>
lot of organizations <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them.
They ship their xxxxxx they introduce their # products, <eol> they make xxxxx numbers, <eol> but # they lack a sense xx <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # <eob> you set <eob> these goals the right
First, # you must answer <eol> xxx "Why?" Why? <eol>
Because transformational <eol> teams <eol> combine their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion and to their purpose, <eob> xxx they develop # a clear and <eob> xxxxxxxxxx sense xx why. <eob>
I to you a story. <eob>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx <eob> entrepreneur. <eob>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eol>
She runs a company called Nuna.
Nuna is a health care company. <eob>
And when <eob> xxx founded, they used data # to serve the # health <eol> lots xx workers at large <eol>
And two years into the life, <eob> the # federal government issued a <eob> to build <eob> the first # ever <eol> cloud database
Now, xxxxxx # remember <eol> that is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> xxx xxxxxx <eob> with disabilities. <eol>
Nuna at # the xxxx <eob> # xxx # just # xx xxx database <eol> had to be built # xx xxx year, <eol> and they xxx xxxxx set commitments <eob> they had <eob> to honor, <eol> xxx frankly, <eob> they weren't # going # xx make <eob> very much money on the <eol>
This # <eob> was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini # seized xxx
jumped # at <eob> # opportunity. <eol> xxx did not flinch.
xxxx <eob>
Well, xxxx a # xxxxxxxx <eol> why.
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism.
And # when he xxx seven, <eob> xx had xxx xxx seizure <eol> at Disneyland. <eol>
# <eob> xxxx <eob> ground. <eob> He <eol>
Jini's <eob> are xxxxxx immigrants.
They came to # <eol> the xxxxxxx <eol> with # resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it up # xx # xxxx <eob> to enroll family # in <eob> Medicaid.
was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> xxx that xxxxxxx bid <eob> on, won <eol> xxx <eob> delivered on that # contract. <eol>
Here's <eob> Jini # to tell # you xxxx <eol>
(Video) Jini Medicaid saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today <eol> it provides for <eol> and millions of # others. <eol>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid.
Every # row of is a life whose story # deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eol>
JD: # Jini's <eob> # xxxxx tells <eob> us that compelling why <eol> can the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to <eob> have accomplished. <eob>
objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, <eol> they are xxx they're a # kind <eol> of vaccine xxxxx thinking.
You # think a rockstar <eol> be <eob> an unlikely xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eob> but for years, Bono # used xxxx <eob> to # xxxx # a global war <eol> xxxxxxx poverty and disease, and xxx organization <eob> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first is xxxx # relief <eol> for the # poorest countries # in world. <eol>
The <eob> xxxx is universal <eol> access <eob> to drugs. <eob>
Now, why these good objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back xx # our # checklist. <eob>
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes.
Action-oriented? <eol>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate?
How <eol>
# xxxxxxx does <eol> passion xxxx xxx # <eob> to do? <eol>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a perfect # rhyme with the head, then # passion means <eob>
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eol> the chemistry # contained # inside # xxx <eol>
gives # us # for risk, <eol> for trust, <eol> where failing not a fireable <eob>
And when xxx have that sort <eob> # structure xxx environment <eob> and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eol>
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eol> and magic # is right # the corner.
xxxx is perfect. <eob>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # key results. <eob> That's xxx # <eol> we meet # our <eob>
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound.
xxxxxxx <eol> aggressive xxx # <eob> realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx and they're verifiable.
# xxx xxxx key # results. <eob>
In xxxxx introduced OKRs to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and Sergey. <eol>
xxxx they are, <eob> # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite.
he really xxxx was, "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eol> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
And I took xxxx <eob> as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, <eol> every Googler has written down <eob> # objectives and xxx key <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and <eol> # <eob> they've xxxxxxxxx them <eob> for everyone to xxxx <eob>
these xxx xxxx for bonuses # or for promotions.
xxxxxxx # <eob> set # aside.
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly <eob> stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> xxxxx was to <eob> # <eol> build <eol> the next client platform the future <eol> of web applications -- in other xxxxx the browser. <eob>
# very thoughtful <eob> how # he chose his # key # results. <eol>
How do you measure <eob> the best browser? <eob>
could xx clicks # or <eob> engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going to decide <eol> Chrome a # great or not. <eol>
So he had this <eob> # one <eol> three-year-long # objective: build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And then every # year he xxxxx to the xxxx # key # results, <eob> of users, he upped the # ante. <eob>
In the first <eob> year, <eol> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx <eol> and he missed it.
He xxx less than <eob> 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised the bar # to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eol>
Somewhat <eol>
In the xxxxx # year, <eob> he the ante once <eob> # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx <eob> # an <eol> marketing campaign, <eol> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx improved # the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eol>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx <eol>
xxx I like story, <eob> not so # xxx the # xxxxx <eob> ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx carefully choosing the objective and then xxxxxxxx to it <eol> year <eob> # after xxxx after <eol>
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like #
Now, <eob> I <eob> think of # OKRs <eol> as vessels xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eol> and <eob> xxxx of our # ambitions. <eob>
What really <eol> matters <eob> xx # the why that we <eol> xxxx into <eob> those # vessels. <eol>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be <eob> for a strong culture <eob> or # for stronger leadership, <eob> # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eol>
I # <eol> to think <eol> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment. <eob>
Do you # # right <eol>
xxxx xxxx <eob> xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do it xxxxxx <eol>

Here's the deal: xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx xx powered today by OKRs.
Now, I've <eob> been xxxxxx the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the <eob> good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eol> xxx I want you <eob> to join # me in this movement. <eol>
Let's fight <eob> for what it is <eob> that # xxxxxxxx <eol> because we can # take xxxx <eol> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
We can take them to # families, to our schools, <eol> even to our governments. <eob>

We can transform # those informations. <eol>

What # history? <eob>
It is # something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eol> should be # focused on xxxxxxx like # Lenin # or <eob>
xx <eob> a result, people <eob> xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something <eol> xxxx was predetermined or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and common people could not <eol> influence it in xxx way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eob> that Russia could been <eol> will a truly # democratic xxxxxxx <eob> # this is due # to the way history has been framed <eol> xxx # Russia. <eol>
And <eol> this is true. <eol>
To prove # it, # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx <eol> to xxx year the xxxx of <eob> the Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if internet <eob> and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx <eol> x social network <eol> xxx dead # people, <eol> named Project1917.com.
My team and x <eol> created # our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eol> and uploaded all possible # real diaries and letters <eol> written by more than 3,000 xxxxxx <eol> 100 ago. <eol>
So any user of our website or <eob> can # follow a <eob> xxxx feed <eol> for each day 1917 <eol> xxx read what people <eol> xxxx Stravinsky # <eob> or Trotsky, <eol> xxxxx xx # Pavlova and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eol> being xxxxxx like <eob> you and me, <eol> xxx demigods, <eol> # we see that <eob> history # <eob> of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxxxxxx # was a <eol> for many Russians, <eob> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx <eol> has always been an autocratic <eol> empire <eob> and <eob> the ideas <eob> of freedom and democracy could # never have prevailed, <eob> just # because xxxxxxxxx <eol> was xxx our destiny.
xxx if we # take broader <eob> it's not <eob> that black and white. <eol>
Yes, # <eol> xxxx # led to <eol> of communist dictatorship.
But this project, <eol> we # xxx that Russia have <eol> # had a # different history <eol> and a xxxxxxxxxx <eol> future, <eol> as any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the posts xxxx # <eol> you learn that Russia xxx <eol> the # first # country # in the <eob> to <eob> abolish the death penalty, or xxx of the xxxxx # ones <eol> to grant women # voting rights.
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced # history <eob> can help a better because <eob> history is just a rehearsal <eol> what's happening xxxxx now.
We xx need new telling history, <eob> and xxxxx <eol> xxx example, <eob> we started # a new <eol> online # project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, xxx that # is # an online series that # you an impression <eol> of year, <eob> a # year by social change that, many ways, <eol> the # world as we <eob> xxxx it <eol>
But we # making that history xxxxx <eob> by xxxx if xxx the <eob> main could xxxxxx ... just <eob> like that? <eob>
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals <eol> were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting for the values, <eob> no if they lived in US or in USSR or xx France or xx # China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By xxxxxxxx history <eob> in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> through # media, <eob> we show that people in # <eob> are not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eol>
gives any user a possibility <eol> xx reclaiming <eol>

Computer algorithms today <eol> xxx <eob> performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx with accuracies, a <eol> xxxxxxx using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx

AI # xx poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on xxx lives in the <eol> future. <eol>
Today, however, <eol> we still face xxxxxxx <eol> challenges <eob> in detecting and <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, <eol> such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eol>
of patients every xxxx <eob> xxxx due to xxxxx and # oral <eol> cancer. <eob>
best # way to # help these patients <eob> is to # perform early # detection and diagnoses of these # diseases. <eob>
So how do # we <eol> detect today, and can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx help? <eol>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eol> are <eol> suspected of these <eol> diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first expensive medical imaging # <eol> technologies xxxx as imaging, <eob> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, <eol> xxxxxxx expert physician <eob> then diagnoses <eob> # talks xx # the patient.
As you # xxx see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eol> xxxxxxxxx # # expert # physicians, expensive <eob> imaging technologies, <eob> xxx # is not # considered <eol> practical <eol> the developing xxxxxx <eob>
And in fact, in <eob> many <eob> industrialized # nations, xx <eol>
So, can we solve # this # problem <eol> using artificial intelligence? <eol>
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional <eob> artificial intelligence # architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> repeat, on an order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eol> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After <eob> xxxxx I would then # go <eol> an expert <eol> would # then analyze those images for # <eob> me. <eob>
And # using those two pieces of <eob> # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> I can # a <eob> # standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning <eob> to # <eol> provide # xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Similar <eob> to the first approach, traditional artificial <eol> approaches <eob> suffer from the same # problem.
xxxxx # amounts xx xxxxx # expert # <eol> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these important <eol> problems facing us today? <eol>
And this is exactly what xx group # at <eob> MIT Media xxxxx
We variety xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx solve xxxx xx the most important <eob> challenges <eob> facing us # in <eob> medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In the # example I shared <eob> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # <eob> was to reduce the number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms.
Our xxxxxx -- we were <eob> # more ambitious, <eob> we wanted xx # reduce <eol> of medical imaging technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eob>
So how did we do it? <eol>
our first goal, xx starting <eol> xxxx # tens and thousands these very expensive medical images, <eol> xxxx traditional <eol> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and I <eol> figured <eol> out a very clever # way to extract # billions <eol> xx information packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and <eob> rendering # of xxxxxxx <eol> on the # medical image. <eob>
In a # we # one image <eol> xxxx <eob> # billions xx training data points, <eob> massively reducing <eob> xx data needed for <eob>
xxx our goal, to # the # <eob> use of # expensive <eol> medical <eol> imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light <eob> acquired either # from a # camera <eol> or <eob> x mobile # phone, xxx the patient. <eol>
Then remember those <eob> billions # of information # packets? <eob>
xx overlaid xxxxx from <eol> xxxxxxx image onto # this image, <eob> something <eob> that xx call a composite image. <eol>
Much to xxx surprise, <eol> we xxxx required -- <eob> I only 50 -- <eol> these images # <eob> our algorithms # <eob> xxxx # <eol> efficiencies.
To # summarize our approach, <eol> instead of using # <eol> very medical # images, <eob> we now train <eol> the AI algorithms <eol> in # an <eol> xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> using 50 of these high-resolution, <eob> but standard # <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and <eol> # <eol> xxxxxx xxxxxxx and provide <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, some very simple, # white light <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx from the instead # of expensive medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that # xx # <eob> to enter xx # era where artificial intelligence is going to make impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think <eob> that thinking <eol> xxxxx traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich xxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eob> about # unorthodox artificial intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which can accept xxxxxxx of data <eob> and xxxxx some xx the most xxxxxxxxx <eol> problems facing # us today, xxxxxxxxxx in health care.

xxxxxxxxxx # <eol> xxxx of immune cell, <eol> helper T cell, <eol> was present # <eol> inside <eol> that <eol> I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eol>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and break your xxxxxx xxx try xxx tape it together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but <eob> it <eob> not be <eob> in xxxx # functional way, <eob> # we'll <eob> get a <eol>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T <eol> xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, xxx muscle <eol> fat cells inside of it, <eob> and # if there's # fat in # <eol> our muscle, isn't <eob> as <eob>
Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eob> xxx body # grow back <eob> without # scars <eol> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even # <eob>
I'm working to create <eob> that give xx # the signals to new tissue <eob> by # the immune response.
We know that # <eol> time <eol> a <eob> # material is xxxxxxxxx # body, <eob> the immune # xxxxxxx # xx # it.
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx <eol> to <eob> insulin pumps to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # xxxxx <eol> new <eob>
when I place material, <eob> scaffold, in the body, <eol> the immune system # creates small <eob> # <eob> environment of cells and proteins <eol> xxxx can change <eob> xxx # <eol> way <eob> that # our <eol> stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eob> our xxxxx # activities, like <eol> going <eob> for a run <eol> or inside binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune <eol> environment # # a scaffold affects # <eob> the # way that our # stem cells # xxxx # and # <eol> develop. <eob>
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eol> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eob> we <eol> get xxx cells instead of muscle.
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eol> of a variety of different <eob> # <eob> plastics # to naturally <eob> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, <eob> that are more or less porous, gels different stiffnesses.
And <eol> researchers can even <eol> xxxx materials release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So # in xxxxxx # orchestrate <eol> xxxxxxxx show cells xx # giving them the correct <eob> stage, cues and props <eob> # can # be changed # for different tissues, just # like a producer xxxxx change the set <eol> for # "Les <eob> # Mis" <eob> versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx combining specific # of signals <eob> that xxxxx our body to <eol> injury to help us # regenerate.
the xxxxxxx we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eol> a moldable filler <eol> even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we aren't # <eob> to wake up xxxxxxxx <eob> xxx xx able to heal Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx <eol> next # Tuesday, either.
But with these # advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx # with our immune system to help and heal wounds, <eol> could xxxxx xxxxxx products # the market <eob> xxxx work with our body's defense system xx # help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe day be # able <eol> # keep pace xxxx a salamander. <eob>

So, as # a child, <eob> I used # to spend # of xx # time <eob> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, # humid, summer # <eob> days, I dash # <eob> the # floor and xxxxx my xxxx front # of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eob> that that experience, <eol> though brief, <eob> a privileged # xxx xxx community. <eol>

During the winter, struggling to get xx xxxxxxxxx would xxxx no choice but # to # <eob> the <eob> after their heat # was xxxx off, <eob> xxxx # <eol> keep their # family comfortable one # <eob> day. <eob>
These xx dangerous <eob> incidents # can <eob> take root when people are # xxxxx with choices. <eob>
In the US, xxxxxxxx xxxxxx percent of their <eob> # income on energy. <eol>
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and rural xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> can <eol> spend # 20, even xx percent <eol> of their income on xxxxxxx <eol>
2015, xxxx caused over 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx xx provide power to # their homes. <eol>
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden. <eob>
xxxxxx burdens are # so <eob> xxxx xxxx just x number. <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx choices: <eol> Do you take your child <eob> to her # flu medicine, xx do # you <eob> feed her? <eob>
Or do you # keep her <eob>
xxxx an <eob> choice, <eob> and # month, <eob> seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy.
This a xxxx # larger and systemic xxxxxx <eol>
Families with <eob> high energy burdens are disproportionately people xx color, who spend xxxx xxx xxxx <eob> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eob> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass <eob> of <eol> 37 million xxxxxx # a xxxx <eob> who are xxxxxx to xxxxxx <eol> energy <eol> for # xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those # with <eob> high energy # burdens <eob> have # a greater likelihood # of conditions <eol> like # heart disease and # asthma. <eol>
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx Mars <eob> and pocket-sized AI, <eob> we have the tools to # xxxxxxx <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eob>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology <eob> are # decreasing. <eob>
even as we <eol> the majority <eob> of xxxxx who own <eol> # much more # than the average American.
This is <eol> why, when # I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit <eob> RETI. <eob>
# is to alleviate energy burdens by working with communities, <eob> utilities and # xxxxxxxxxx alike <eob> provide <eol> to # <eol> energy, energy energy technology.
But # there's no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe in # the xxxxx <eol> of # local <eob> in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect <eob> of relationships.
So xx by working directly the communities <eob> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx <eob>
We <eol> host <eol> and <eob> events # for communities to # xxxxxx poverty, <eol> and how making even <eol> updates to their homes like xxxxxx <eob> insulation windows <eol> and heaters <eol> # go # x <eol> long way # xx # maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting <eob> to community # solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart # home research <eob> and # installation xxxxxxxx <eob> to help families bring # down <eol> their # <eob> bills. <eol>
We're xxxx working # directly with elected # <eob> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision of # energy and resilience <eob> we have to <eol> xxxx together sustainably. <eol>
Now, the US # spends over # three billion a year <eob> energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eob> millions # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx they're only able xx help <eob> a <eob> xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure and impartial access <eol> to energy <eol> that clean, reliable and affordable.
At # scale, microgrid technology, <eol> xxx energy efficiency dramatically <eob> # improve xxxxxx health.
And for those xxxx # high <eob> burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim 20 <eob> percent xx their income -- xx # percent of a person's income struggling to make xxxx # meet. <eol>
xxxx is life-changing. <eob>
This is xx for # use # their energy <eob> savings <eob> to sponsor their future. <eob>
I xxxxx # back to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, xxx impossible choices <eol> xxxx # they xxxx and the effect it had on xxxxx <eob>

There are xxxxxxxx <eol> nationwide # having to make the # <eob> same xxxxxxx xxxxxx
And # high energy burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but through relationships <eob> with communities technology, <eob> we have # the paths to overcome them. <eob>

Now, what does this have to xx <eol> with xxx one # us? <eol>
it's # one xxx # of illustrating # what I <eob> xxxxxxx to xx the <eob> # most xxxxxxxxx change <eob> that needed in ways of xxxxxxx

But # the # question is: <eob> In # order # to # get there, are xx <eol> # willing to # xxxx up?
A # few <eol> years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eob> that wanted to # embark <eol> a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their <eob> offering to be # intuitive, more relevant. <eol>
Now, I'm xxx sure <eob> how many of you <eol> # a # bank from the inside, <eol> so let me try to illustrate <eol> # xxxx traditional banks like. <eob>
You see lots # of people # suits taking elevators xx <eol> go <eob> to department, <eob> sitting with marketers, xxxxxxxxx with engineers, # etc. <eob>
You see meetings # 20 # people nothing gets <eol>
Great xxxxxx They end <eol> up PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eol>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eob> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting <eob> # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx
this # xxxx xxxx in to transform, would have <eol> xx # improve <eol> time <eob> to market by changing <eob> their ways xx working as well. <eol>
But xxxx <eob>
To # get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx <eob> to xxx have x look companies <eol> that <eob> seem # to xx <eol> more innovative, like Google, <eol> Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And remember how we xxxx # <eob> the halls at xxx xx these # companies in # December 2014, a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and a xxxx # xx bankers.
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we # <eob> asked, <eob> xxxx # <eol> is # your company organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx to # get org # chart. <eob>
But <eol> instead, they used strange drawings with funny # names like # and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eol> xx explain how xxxx were organized. <eob>
So then tried to # <eol> that # our own world. <eob>
We # xxxxxx <eol> "How many # people <eob> are xxxxxxx for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who you xxxxxx to?" depends". <eob>
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" <eol> xxx depends". <eob>
You can our surprise. <eob>
xx were # xxxxxx for what <eol> we <eob> thought <eol> xx the basic principles of organizations, <eob> and answer <eob> was, "It xxxxxxxxx
Now, over the # course # of that day, <eol> we gained <eob> understanding of # <eol>
They believed in xxx power <eol> of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups.
They xxx product people engineers in the <eol> same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and # test ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx <eol> independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eol>
xxxx # did not between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They all the skills needed there in the team. <eol>
xxxx # at end <eol> of <eob> that <eob> day, <eol> xx had a <eob> to reflect <eol> xx <eob> what we # had learned. <eob>
And we started to # xxxx # their <eol> so # we already thinking <eob> xx how <eol> xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eol>
then, one # of the hosts, <eob> guy # who # had not # said a word # all # he suddenly xxxxx xxx x see you like xxx model. <eob>
But I # have one for # you: <eol> What # are you to give xxxx <eob> we willing # to give up? <eob>
xxx not # xxxx # an answer immediately, xxx we # knew # xx was right. <eol>
Change is only about <eob> xxxxxxxxx the <eob> xxxx <eob> it's about <eob> giving <eol> some of old as well. <eob>
Now, over # the # past years, I worked with companies <eol> all # xxxx # the world <eol> to change <eol> their xxxx xx # working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has xxx skeptics about why this is <eol> xxxxx xx <eob> for them. <eol>
"Our # is more complex," <eol> or # have the xxxxxx # xx # like <eob> we <eob> xxxx or "Regulators <eob> just <eob> won't allow this <eol> in our # industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx bank and <eob> also <eol> for the other companies xxxx x # have worked with <eob> change was possible. <eol>
a year, # we up old silos between # marketing, <eol> product, channels and <eob> xxx
Three # employees # <eob> were <eol> into 350 <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams. <eol>
So instead of product people <eob> sitting just with # <eob> people <eol> engineers engineers, <eol> x product # person and an engineer <eol> xxxx now xxxxxxx of xxx xxxxx <eob>
You <eol> could be a xxxxxx <eob> of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eol> or for xxx mobile # banking app, xxxx <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> of xxxx new organization, <eob> people were xxxxxxx hands <eol> for # <eob> very # xxxxx # time, <eol> only to find xxx xxxx been xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from <eob> # each other but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # <eob> reports for last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, you're # the guy # that I xxxxxx chasing for answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee <eol> xxxxxxxx every <eol>
If the product guy has an idea, <eob> he can just # raise # it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eob> xxx # is # sitting right next # to him. <eob>
They xxxxxx test <eob> with customers <eob> immediately # <eob> -- xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # no xxx <eol> tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# getting there is not # easy. <eob>
And <eol> # <eol> it # turns out, <eob> are # you willing to give up?" <eob> is # exactly # right <eol> # to xxxx <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eol>
xxxxxxx # of going <eob> up xxx # down <eob> the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx want # xxx team <eob> to # decide. <eob>
xx do we need xxx the skills <eob> and for xxxx <eol> in # the team. <eol>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eol> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eob> different xxxxxxxxx # today? <eob>
xx should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eol>
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things across # xxxxxx <eol>
We still need <eol> some xxxx of management xxxxxxx <eob>
# these changes <eob> to structure and process procedure -- they xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, x found the most <eob> difficult thing to change is our own behavior. <eob>
Let xx try to illustrate. <eol>
If we # these teams <eob> to be fast, flexible, creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx <eob> commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, # how # xxx <eob>
No micromanagers.
But <eob> # it also # each employee <eol> needs to <eob> become leader, regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title.
It's # about all of <eol> # us up to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now <eob> obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all # <eob> teams xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx because # that would <eob> certainly lead # to chaos.
# we need and # autonomy <eol> at # same just <eob> xxxx a flock # of birds. <eob>
In # <eob> organizational xxxxxxxx this requires new behaviors, <eob> and # each new behavior, <eol> there xx <eol> on something as # well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure xxxx everyone # in xxx organization is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose the why <eob> and the -- what. <eob>
But # <eob> then xxxx xxxx let go <eob> # trust their # teams to the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to get # there.
Now, <eob> creating alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> communication. <eob>
But you know # how say that information is a source of <eob> xxxxxx
Well, for some managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information may feel as # if <eob> they're giving up xxxx power. <eol>
xxx it's # not just managers.
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as <eob> well. <eob>
these # <eol> the # <eob> xxxxx <eol> typically work in short # sprints, <eob> and at the end <eob> # # sprint, <eob> they organize # a <eol> demo session xx share # the output of # <eob> what they've done, transparently.
xxxx <eob> each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working xx
Now, all this transparency be uncomfortable xxx people, # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eol> xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do xx transparent for everyone.
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eol> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either. <eob>
One executive # at # another company <eob> to explain he used to <eol> be a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eol> instead of looking at # status reports, <eol> he xxxxx walk <eob> # xxxx xx # the team floors <eol> attend one of <eol> their sessions.
xxx instead of # telling people what xx <eob> looks # <eol> ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change <eob> for # <eob> someone # who <eol> used # xx be <eol> master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eob>
In xxxxxxxx many # projects would run <eob> over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
xxx I have # <eob> more # transparency, I can course-correct <eol> much <eol> # earlier if needed". <eob>
And managers <eol> need to # change as well.
First # <eob> of <eob> all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eol> less xx a need <eol> for <eob> middle xxxxxxxxx
And in world, # there was <eob> this idea of thinkers and #
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eol>
xxx instead xx only <eob> managing other # people, <eol> middle # managers were expected to player-coaches.
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, you have just been <eob> other people what to xxx but now xxxxxx expected <eol> to # # # again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eol> and great people # leave the # company.
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy.
xxx of this is hard <eob>
xxx # it's worth it. <eol>
xxx companies that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx <eob> new # features # few times <eob>
xxx they <eob> have releases every few # <eol> # without # xxxxxxxxx the xxx tape, <eob> whole xxxxxxxxxxxx becomes more efficient. <eob>
And # if you walk the # halls <eol> xx these today, you just <eob> feel <eob> a new energy. <eob>
It # <eob> feels as if you're # xxxxxxx <eol> the of x very large <eob> start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to <eob> # respond to <eob>
xxxxx is getting faster and more # <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> so we # need # to reboot # our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change is <eob> not # structure <eob> or process # <eob> and xxxx also <eob> not <eol> senior taking charge.
Leaders xx all of those <eol> in # the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>

xx long as they <eob> can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are.
Our focus on # work <eol> didn't <eob> happen accidentally. <eol>
It was <eob> a <eol> conscious choice from the very # beginning. <eol>
Notice x don't xxx xxx word # "remote," because it sets up the expectation, <eob> xxxx some are <eob> essential <eol> and some aren't.
use xxx word "distributed" <eol> xxxxxxxx # what we do, <eol> where everyone xx <eol> on # xxxxxxx field.
I think a # distributed workforce <eol> is # most effective <eob> xxx to # company. <eob>
The key is <eob> you have to # consciously.
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, many of # xxx first # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx people xxx never met # #
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years.
I # wanted to continue xxxx for one # reason. <eob>
I believe # that talent and <eob> are equally distributed <eob> the world. <eob> is # not.
In <eol> the tech xxxxxxxxx fish xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> the # <eob> same # small or xxxx
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx fish from # the entire ocean. <eol>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # who # grew up <eol> in xxxxx # but lives in California, <eob> # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eol> wakes up and goes to <eol> sleep <eol> wherever they are xx # world. They bring a # <eol> understanding # <eol> of xxxx # culture <eol> and # a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of xxx decision go <eol> distributed, there's a desire to give people autonomy over # how # xxxx do their work.
Unless you're in a <eob> where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, you can make your # own schedule. <eob>
Everyone have a xxxxxx <eol> office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eol> you # can choose there's music <eol> xxx when silence. <eol>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx <eol> the xxxx should be.
You <eob> can save the time <eol> spend commuting and put xx into things <eob> that important xx <eob>
A # distributed workforce is ideal a <eob> # company. <eol>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, <eob> "This works for <eol> y'all, <eob> xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eol> If # xxx <eob> have # an # xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # do # <eol> few xxxxxx to # build distributed <eob>
First: document everything. <eob>
In xx it's easy <eol> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, <eol> in the kitchen, # in xxx
But if # <eob> people work remotely and some members of the team <eol> are having conversations <eob> they xxxxx xxxx access <eob> they'll these <eob> xxxxxxxxx being made <eob> without understanding the xxxx <eob>
Always <eob> leave x trail # of xxxxx you were <eol> and what xxx were thinking about. <eol>
This # allows others pick xx <eol> you <eol> # left off.
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eol> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> it's great to think as # an organization <eob> people and xxxxxx <eob>
have as much communication as possible xxxxxxx <eol>
xxxx # everything's and <eol> public, <eol> it <eob> allows # people up <eob>
You xxxx xxxx to find xxx #
There xxx so xxxx <eob> apps <eob> and xxxxxxxx <eob> that help # with day-to-day communication, xxxxx <eob> conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The things # that changed how # <eob> you xxxx <eob> xxxxxxxx aren't objects # anymore.
They're things you access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So xxxxxxxxxx with xxxxxxxxx <eob> tools that enable # collaboration, <eob> see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face # time. <eob>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place xx weeks out of the year <eob> and you # might <eol> three four # xxxxx apart. <eob>
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> a # <eob> year xx # do a grand # xxxxx xxx entire company <eol> comes for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is people. xxxx to <eob> make sure everyone's aligned and <eob> on xxxx page, <eob> and xxxx xxxx # a deeper <eob> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # <eob> the rest xx <eol> the year, <eob> they can bring together <eob> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy. <eob>
And the <eob> xxxxx practice: <eol> give people xxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx <eob> their # own work <eob> environment.
Every person # at Automattic <eob> has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx put towards a co-working # xxxxx <eob> or to <eob> buy so # <eol> they don't out of xxx coffee shop.
One # in Seattle xx pool their <eob> stipends together and rented a # on <eob> x xxxxxxx pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eol> gets x home-office stipend. <eol>
xxxx # is money can <eob> invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # right # chair, monitor, <eol> # right xxxx so # they <eob> can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eol>
Today, there are just a <eol> # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx
In a decade or # xxxx x predict that 90 percent of companies that are to be # changing <eob> the # <eob> course of xxx xxxxx <eob> are going function way. <eob>
They will to be distributed # first, or # <eol> they'll # be <eob> replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx <eob> xxxxx what you're # going xx xxxxx next, consider xxx # you can tap into # global talent, <eob> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work <eob> where they # feel they should <eob> and still # participate fully whatever <eob> it # is you're creating together.
