Imagine waking up a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers questioning your right to existence <eol> for something that <eol> you online, <eob> waking up to # an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome # to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women <eol> face xx Pakistan is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes deadly <eob>
This xxxx of harassment keeps women <eol> from <eol> accessing xxx internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is xxx sixth most populous <eol> country <eob> the world, <eob> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access to technologies, and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down <eob> with xxx rise new technologies.
Pakistan <eob> is # also the birthplace of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect <eob> is # where <eob> the twisted concept of honor <eob> is linked # to women and <eob> # their bodies; where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eob> even kill them <eob> sometimes the name so-called "family honor"; where xxxxx <eol> # are left # to die right outside their houses for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's # xxx honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a small village <eob> in # Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher <eol> education.
The # elders of # my family <eob> allow women <eol> to pursue # their higher education or xxxxx careers. <eol>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father # was # <eob> one who <eol> really <eob> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns of <eol>
But in xxx end, I knew <eob> it's either <eob> me xx them, <eob> chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
My xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and <eob> for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own x mobile <eob> until x was married. <eob>
And even I was <eob> married, <eob> this tool # became a tool <eol> for my xxx <eol> surveillance. <eol>
xxxx I resisted this idea <eol> of surveilled my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve # of this <eob> and threw me # out of # his house, <eob> along with <eol> my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was # the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why?
are women not # allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights enshrined in <eol> our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
While the law states x xxxxx <eol> has # the same equal to the # information, <eob> why is it always men -- # brothers, <eob> fathers and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So to take # a step, <eob> instead of # keep questioning <eob> these patriarchal <eol> and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to the issues <eol> and # women's experiences in online spaces <eol> and # cyberharassment. <eob>
lobbying xxx free and safe internet <eob> xx convincing young women <eob> that to the safe xxxxxxxx <eol> is <eob> their fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my part <eol> in igniting # the spark <eol> to address # the questions <eob> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a xxxx in my heart, <eob> and <eob> to offer a solution to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December xxxx -- <eob> (Applause)
to extend my support to # the women <eol> who do xxx know who to turn to <eol> when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online. <eob>
I think of the women # who do not # have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to # deal with the mental trauma <eob> when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eol> and they go about daily <eob> xxxxxxxx that is x rape threat in their <eob> in-box.
Safe access to the <eol> is an to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting # for equality. <eol>

(Applause) <eol>
at # critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # failing
Why? <eob>
In # some cases, # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, <eol> they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives.
And this # is unacceptable. <eol>
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct these wrongs?
xxx are we # xxxxx <eol> to <eob> xxxxxx the right course? <eob>
It's not going to be easy. <eob>
For I've worked with <eob> talented teams <eob> and they've # chosen the right objectives <eol> and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, others of # them have <eob>
And <eol> today # # to share <eol> with xxx what # really makes x xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> that's what's crucial, how xxx why <eob> they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right # goals for the right reasons.
Let's go back to # 1975. <eob>
Yep, this # # me.
I've got a xxx to learn, <eol> I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long # hair, <eol> but # I'm # working under <eob> Andy Grove, who's been called the # greatest manager <eob> of <eol> his or any # other era.
Andy was # a superb and also a teacher, <eob> and he said # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy # a system <eob> called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx # kind of <eob> rolls off xxx tongue, doesn't it?
xxx it's all about excellent <eob>
So a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of Andy xxxxxx <eob>
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # <eob> phrases <eol> management by objective systems <eob> are the # objectives and the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the end you can # look <eol> and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I not that?" No. Simple.
John <eob> Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> are a # simple goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and they # work <eol> for organizations, <eol> they work teams, they even work for individuals. <eob>
are what <eol> want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how <eol> I'm going xx get that done.
Objectives. Key <eob> results. <eol>
What and how. <eob>
But here's the truth: xxxx of us are goals wrong, <eob> and most xx us are not setting goals at all. <eol>
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their numbers, <eob> but they lack a sense of purpose to xxxxxxx their teams. <eob>
So # xxx do you set <eol> these goals the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, must <eob> answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because truly <eol> transformational teams combine xxxxx ambitions to their # passion and to their # purpose, <eob> they develop a clear <eol> and <eob> compelling # sense of why. <eob>
x want to tell you # a story.
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name <eob> is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs <eob> of lots of workers # at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, <eol> the government issued a proposal <eob> to build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll # <eol> that Medicaid is that # program that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our # xxxxx our children <eob> and people with disabilities.
Nuna <eob> the time was # just 15 people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, <eob> and # they had a set of commitments <eol> xxxx they xxx to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money xx the project. <eob>
xxxx xxx a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, it's a <eob> personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And he was seven, <eob> he had his <eol> # <eol> xxxxx grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to the <eob> ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants. <eob>
They came # to the # country <eol> xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eol> so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine # years <eol> old. <eol>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> xxx that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on that xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxx Jini to tell <eob> you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from <eol> bankruptcy, <eob> and # today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for millions others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of xxxx # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> with dignity.
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> are inspiring, and they're kind of xxxxxxx <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think # a rockstar <eob> would be unlikely user <eol> of <eob> Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eob> to wage <eol> a global xxx <eol> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eol> audacious objectives. <eob>
The # is xxxx relief <eob> for the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eob>
The next xxxxxxxxx access <eol> anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good <eol>
xxxxx xx back to # our checklist. <eob>
Check. # Concrete? Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's <eob> just listen to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does # your passion <eol> lead xxx to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a rhyme <eob> # with the # <eob> head, <eob> then your passion means nothing. <eob>
# OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eol> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx <eob>
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for <eob> risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable offense. <eob>
And <eob> when you have that sort <eol> xx structure and environment <eob> and the right people, magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: I xxxx that. <eol>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> and magic is right around the # corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, <eob> xxxx Bono <eol> the # whats # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn # attention the xxxxx
Remember, the hows the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're <eob> aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry # and Sergey. <eol>
Here they <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eol>
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said <eob> he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eol>
What he really # said was, "We any other <eol> to manage this company, <eol> so it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eol>
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written down <eob> her objectives and her key <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've xxxxxxxxx # them for everyone to <eob>
And these are not used <eob> for bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # set aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a <eob> Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build the xxxx generation client platform <eob> for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> in other words, build xxx browser. <eol>
He was very xxxxxxxxxx <eol> about how # he chose his key results.
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eob> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not. <eob>
So he this # one three-year-long objective: build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the ante. <eob>
In first year, his # was 20 million users <eob> and <eob> he missed it. <eol>
He less xxxx 10.
Second year, he <eob> raised <eol> the <eob> bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eol>
xxxxxxxx better. <eol>
In the # third year, he upped the ante once xxxx <eol> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol> marketing campaign, broader distribution, <eol> improved xxx technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 # million users. <eob>
Here's why I like <eol> this # story, xxx so much for the happy <eob> but it someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eob> year after year after year. <eol>
It's x perfect story for nerd me. <eol>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as <eol> vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
really matters is # the xxx <eob> that xx pour xxxx those vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work.
are x silver # bullet.
They're not going to # <eol> a substitute a strong culture <eob> or for leadership, <eol> but # when those # <eol> fundamentals are # in place, they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eob>
I # want you # to # think about your <eob> life for a moment. <eob>
Do you <eob> # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write # down your values, <eob> your objectives and your <eob> key results.
xx it today. <eob>
If # like some feedback on them, <eol> you # can send them <eob> to me.
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals of an Intel, of a Nuna, of xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx <eob> affordable health <eob> care, <eol> high-quality for # everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, access to xxx the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every <eob> one of those goals <eol> is powered xxxxx by OKRs.
Now, I've been called <eol> the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs for spreading good <eob> gospel <eob> according # to Andy xxxxxx <eob> but I want you <eol> to join xx # in this # movement.
Let's fight what it is <eol> xxxx really <eob> # matters, <eob> because we <eol> can # take OKRs <eob> beyond our businesses.
# can take them to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to # our governments. <eol>
We can xxxx those # governments accountable.
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track <eob> if we can <eob> and do measure <eol> what really matters.
Thank <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
What is history? <eol>
It is something written by the winners. <eob>
is a stereotype that history should be <eol> focused <eob> on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin <eol> or Trotsky. <eol>
As a result, people <eol> in countries, like mine, Russia, <eol> look at as something <eol> that was <eob> or determined xx leaders, and common people could xxx <eol> influence it in <eob> any <eol> way.
Many Russians today do not believe that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eob> or ever will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to the way <eob> history has xxxx framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this <eol> is true. <eob>
To prove it, <eob> I spent two # <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eol> to the year 1917, <eob> the year xx the <eob> Russian Revolution. <eob>
x asked myself, what if the internet <eol> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eol>
So last year, we built <eol> a # social network xxx dead people, named Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team <eob> and I created our software, digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people 100 # years ago.
So any user of our website # xx application <eob> follow <eob> a feed <eob> xxx each day of <eol> 1917 <eol> and read what people <eol> like # xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like # you <eol> xxx me, <eob> not # <eol> demigods, and we see that history consists <eol> of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxx project was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx <eob> who used to think that our country has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy could never <eol> have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eol> xxx xxx our destiny. <eob>
But we take a broader look, <eol> it's not that black and white. <eob>
1917 # led to 70 years of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx this # project, we see # that Russia <eol> could # have <eol> had a different history <eob> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as # any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eol> you learn that xxxxxx was first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, or one the first ones <eob> to <eob> grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing # history and understanding <eol> xxx # <eob> ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eol> can help # us create <eob> a future, <eol> because history is xxxx a rehearsal <eol> of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eob>
We <eol> do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this xxxxx for example, <eob> we started a # xxx online project <eol> that called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary that gives you an impression <eob> of that xxxxx a year marked by global social change <eob> that, many ways, <eol> xxxxxxx the world as know it now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all # the main <eol> could use mobile phones # ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we <eob> see that x lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and were fighting the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in <eol> the US or in USSR <eob> or France or in China or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, through # social media, <eob> we show that people xx power <eol> are not the only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives # any user a possibility <eob> of reclaiming history. <eob>
people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eob>
We shape <eob>
We <eob> all make history. <eob>
you. <eol>

algorithms today are performing incredible tasks <eol> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using <eob> xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eob>
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eol> is often referred to xx AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eol> on our lives in the # future. <eob>
Today, # however, <eol> we still xxxx <eol> massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in <eob> detecting and diagnosing several # life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious diseases xxx cancer.
xxxxxxxxx of every <eol> lose their # lives <eob> due to liver and # oral cancer.
Our xxxx way xx <eob> help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases. <eob>
So how xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help?
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert physician xxxxx # orders <eob> very expensive <eob> medical xxxxxxx technologies <eol> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, <eol> CTs, <eol> MRIs, # to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are # collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eob> those images and talks to the patient. <eob>
As you can see, this is <eol> a very process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, and is considered practical <eol> for the # developing world. <eob>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can # we this <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eob> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eol> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> these very expensive medical # <eob> first to be generated. <eol>
After that, I would then # <eol> # an # expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eol> those images for <eol>
And # using those two pieces xx information, <eob> I can train a standard deep neural network xx deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's # diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, <eob> traditional # <eob> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> xxx # <eob> expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we invent more scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> intelligence <eob> architectures to solve these very <eol> problems facing today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at MIT Media xxx does.
We have invented # a variety <eol> of unorthodox # AI architectures <eol> to solve <eol> some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today <eol> in medical imaging and clinical <eol> # trials. <eob>
In # the example I shared with you today, <eol> we had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal <eob> was to reduce <eol> xxx number of images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # <eol> more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to reduce the use <eol> of <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients.
So how we # do it? <eob>
For our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and thousands <eob> of these very # expensive <eob> images, <eob> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started a single medical image. <eob>
From this # image, my team and x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information # packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering xx the disease <eol> xx the medical image.
In <eob> x sense, we converted # one <eol> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the # amount of data <eol> needed xxx <eol> training. <eol>
For our second xxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx the use expensive <eob> medical <eob> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eob> billions of information <eob> # packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from <eol> xxx medical image onto this creating something <eol> that we call a composite image. <eob>
Much <eob> to our we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, # <eob> xxxx # 50 # -- <eob> of composite images to train <eol> xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize xxx approach, <eol> instead of using <eob> very expensive medical # images, <eol> now train the AI <eol> in an # unorthodox way, <eob> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras xxx xxxxxx phones, and provide diagnosis.
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can # accept, <eob> in the future and even right now, some # very simple, # white light <eol> photographs from patient, <eob> of # expensive <eol> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I believe <eob> that we <eob> are # poised <eob> to enter an <eol> # where artificial # intelligence is <eob> to make an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> impact # on our xxxxxxx <eol>
I think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which data-rich but application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue # thinking <eob> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eol> which can accept # small xxxxxxx # of data and solve some of the most important <eol> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx <eob> especially in xxxxxx # care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine and, like getting # over a cold, <eob> you could your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, xx we have <eob> an operation or # xx accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eol> and often left with scars <eob> and painful side effects <eob> of our regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx <eob> give <eob> the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
like vaccines instruct our body to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build tissues <eob> and quickly heal wounds.
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several # organisms that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and # even us mere <eob> can # regrow our liver after losing more than half of its original mass. <eob>
To make xxxx magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eob> can wounds # and <eob> build # tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eob> xxx immune system defends <eol> our # body from <eol> danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eol> I was able to key players in our fight to build back xxx cuts and bruises.
xxxx looking at materials <eol> that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured xxxx these materials, <eol> xxxxx was a large number <eol> of immune xxxxx <eob> in xxxx material and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
xx in this case, <eob> instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off <eol> towards infection fight bacteria, <eob> they're rushing toward # an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific type of xxxxxx cell, <eob> the helper T cell, was present inside material that I implanted <eob> xxx absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like when you were x kid <eol> and <eob> # you'd break your pencil <eol> try # and tape it back together again, <eob> can # heal, <eob> but # it might <eol> not be <eol> # the most functional way, <eol> and we'll xxx a scar. <eob>
So if # we xxxxx have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx as # strong. <eol>
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back without these scars and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eol>
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals to build new tissue <eol> xx changing the immune <eob>
We know that any time <eob> a material # implanted in our # body, the immune system will xxxxxxx to it.
This ranges xxxx pacemakers <eol> to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials # that engineers are using <eol> xx try and new <eol>
xx when # I xxxxx that material, <eol> or # scaffold, in body, <eob> the <eol> immune creates <eol> small environment cells and proteins that change the xxx <eob> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
just like the # weather <eol> affects our # daily activities, <eob> like # going for a run <eob> or <eob> staying and <eob> entire TV show # Netflix, <eob> immune of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eob> our stem cells grow and develop. <eol>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the signals, we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds # are <eol> of a different things, <eob> plastics to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx sponges <eob> that are or less porous, <eol> gels <eob> of stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals time. <eob>
xx other # words, <eob> we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of <eob> cells <eob> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props that can be changed # different <eob> just <eol> like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of signals <eol> that mimic # how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In # the future, # we see a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going to xxxx up tomorrow <eol> and be able xx heal # like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, <eol> and # working with our immune system to build tissue and heal wounds, <eol> we could begin seeing <eol> products <eol> on the market <eol> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able <eol> xx keep <eob> pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

as a child, I used spend all of <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, <eob> days, <eol> x would dash xxxxxx # floor <eob> xxx stick my face in # front of <eob> her only air conditioner.
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple <eob> experience, though # <eol> was a privileged one in # our community.
Growing up, stories of <eob> having to set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me. <eob>
During # the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no choice <eob> xx bypass the meter <eol> after their heat shut off, <eob> xxxx to keep their family <eol> comfortable for <eol> one more day. <eob>
xxxxx of dangerous <eol> incidents xxx take root <eob> when people # are faced <eob> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on # energy. <eol>
In # contrast, # low-income <eol> and xxxxx <eob> # xxxxxxxxxxx xxx # spend 20, 30 percent of <eob> their income on <eob> energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide # power to their homes.
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are xx <eob> much more <eol> than just a number. <eob>
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # you take child <eob> get her flu medicine, <eob> or <eob> do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and nearly every month, seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with <eob> high # energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of <eob> color, <eob> who spend more per square <eob> foot <eol> than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, <eol> and even schoolteachers <eol> who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy <eob> for <eob> their most needs. <eob>
As a result, those <eob> xxxx <eol> xxxx energy burdens <eob> have <eob> a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma.
Look -- # given rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized <eob> # <eob> we have the xxxxx to address <eol> these # systemic inequities. <eol>
The is <eob>
Cost xx renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology are all decreasing. <eob>
even as we approach cost xxxxxxx <eob> the majority of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American. <eob>
This is why, # when I was <eob> 22, <eol> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by # with # communities, <eob> utilities and # government agencies <eob> alike to provide equitable access to clean energy, <eol> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eol>
I believe the power <eol> of local # communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eob> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
So start by working directly <eob> with the communities <eob> xxxx have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eol> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eob> and making even small updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation windows and water heaters <eol> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting # <eol> xx community solar <eob> and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation # programs <eob> to help families <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're even working # xxxxxxxx <eol> with <eob> xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, because to see this vision of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eob> we xxxx to # work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, xxx # US spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do help <eol> millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only able to help <eol> fraction of # those in need. <eob>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eob> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone <eol> is not <eob>
But by building energy equity and # resilience into our communities, <eol> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to that is clean, <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At scale, # <eob> microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and efficiency <eob> dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eob>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eob> 20 # their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a # person's income <eol> who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eob>
This is # life-changing. <eol>
This is an opportunity <eol> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eol> to xxxxxxx their future. <eol>
I think back to my <eob> great-grandmother <eol> and xxx neighbors, the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # to make and xxx # effect # <eol> our whole xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this # is not just about # them.
There # are xxxxxxxx nationwide having <eol> to make the same # impossible choices today.
And I know high energy burdens <eol> xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eob> but # through <eob> relationships with communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And when we do, <eob> we will # all be more resilient. <eob>

Have ever <eol> a flock of birds work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, <eob> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they # all would have <eob> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed <eol> would <eol> simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these birds are aligned on <eob> x few simple rules, allowing every single bird <eob> to make autonomous decisions <eol> while still flying in perfect synchrony.
alignment enables their <eob> autonomy, <eob> and their <eol> autonomy <eol> xxxxx them xxxx and flexible. <eob>
xxxx what does this have to <eol> do <eol> with any one of # us? <eob>
Well, it's one # of xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> I <eol> xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eob> that is needed in <eol> ways of working # today. <eob>
The world getting faster <eob> and more complex, <eob> so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx <eob> a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eol> that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions <eob> faster. <eol>
the question is: <eob> In order to get there, <eob> what are we willing to give xxx <eob>
few years <eol> ago, # I was <eob> working with a <eob> wanted to embark <eol> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They # wanted # <eol> xxxxx offering to be simpler, <eol> intuitive, <eol> xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many you <eol> have <eob> seen a bank from the # inside, <eob> so # let me try to illustrate <eol> xxxx many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people <eol> in suits <eob> taking elevators to go <eob> to their # department, <eob> marketers # sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers with engineers, <eob> etc. <eob>
You see meetings with xx people <eol> where nothing gets decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx <eol>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between <eol> departments. <eol>
anything # done xxx take forever. <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to # transform, they would have to improve <eol> # <eob> to market <eob> by drastically xxxxxxxx <eol> their ways xx as well. <eob>
xxx how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided to # go and have a look at # <eob> companies <eob> # seem to <eob> be more innovative, xxxx Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember # how we <eol> xxxx walking <eol> the xxxxx at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx x management consultant <eob> and a xxxx of # bankers. <eol>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots # of # xxxxxx creative <eol> employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your <eol> company organized?" <eob> we expected xx # <eob> get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> funny names like # "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and "tribes" # explain they were organized. <eob>
So <eob> then we tried to xxxxxxxxx <eol> that to our # own world. <eob>
We asked, "How people <eob> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides your priorities?" <eob> "It
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were # asking # for what we thought <eol> were some # of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and their answer xxxx "It depends". <eob>
Now, over the course of <eol> that xxxx xx gained a better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their model. <eob>
They believed in # power of <eol> small, teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
xxxx had product people <eol> and # IT engineers in the same team <eol> so <eol> they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of # others in the # company. <eob>
They did not need handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had all the skills needed <eol> right there # in the team.
Now, at # the end <eol> of that day, <eob> we had a session <eob> to reflect xx what we had learned.
And xx had started to like their model, <eob> xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # bank. <eol>
But xxxxx # one of the hosts, <eob> a guy who <eob> had not said a word all <eob> day, <eol> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see like our # model. <eol>
But # I have one question for you: What # are willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give up? <eol>
We did not <eob> have xx answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eol>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> on some # of the <eob> old as # <eob>
Now, over the past <eol> five years, <eol> I # have # worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their xxxx <eob> # of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own skeptics about <eol> why this not <eol> going work # xxx them.
"Our product is more complex," <eob> xx "They # have <eol> the # legacy IT like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators # just won't this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank and also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I worked with afterwards, change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we # completely blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eol> xxxxxxxx channels and IT. <eol>
Three # employees xxxx # <eol> into # 350 teams. <eob>
So instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with <eob> product # people and engineers with <eob> engineers, <eob> a # product # person and an engineer <eol> were now members <eob> of the same
You could be a member of a team <eol> responsible <eob> for account opening <eol> or the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> that # new organization, <eob> some people xxxxxxx hands <eol> for the very <eob> first time, <eob> to # find <eob> out that they # had been <eol> sitting two # away from each <eob> other <eol> but they xxxx sending each # other emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 # years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're <eol> the guy # that # I was always chasing xxx answers". <eob> <eob>
But they're <eol> every day.
xx the product <eob> guy xxx an idea, <eol> xx can just raise <eob> to get input the engineer <eob> xxx sitting right next # to # him. <eob>
They can to test with customers immediately -- <eol> no <eol> handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red xxxxx <eob> xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eob>
Now, getting there is # not # easy. <eob>
xxx # as it turns out, <eob> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" is exactly the # right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
of decisions <eol> up and down the organization, <eob> we want the <eob> team to decide. <eob>
But to xx so, we need all the # and expertise for that # decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eol> are working in <eob> different buildings, <eob> different cities or <eol> different countries today? <eol>
Or should we invest in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way # we do things <eob> across these <eob>
We still some kind of management
Now, all these changes structure <eol> process and procedure -- <eob> xxxx # are not <eob>
in the end, <eob> I found that the # most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> xx our own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Let me # try to illustrate. <eol>
we # want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous.
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when # to <eob> do, how to do. <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that each <eol> xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now # obviously, we also # cannot afford <eob> to have # all teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> xxxxxxx that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos.
So we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eol> just a flock of
In an organizational setting, requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new behavior, <eol> there <eob> # is giving up on something <eob> old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make sure xxxx # everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall -- # the why -- <eob> overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
then they have to let # go <eol> and trust # their # <eob> teams <eob> to make <eob> the right <eob> decisions <eol> on how to get # there.
Now, creating alignment requires open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you how they say <eob> that information # is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing information may # feel as <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
it's not <eol> just managers. <eol>
xxx teams need to <eob> communicate <eol> openly and transparently well.
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx teams <eob> typically work # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> share the output what they've transparently.
And every <eob> each # member of the gives # an update <eob> of what they are <eob> # working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can xx uncomfortable people, <eol> because there <eob> xx <eol> no place to # hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone.
So, # is not easy, <eob> providing autonomy <eol> not xx obvious, either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain xxx he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, # today, to know <eob> how things # are # going, instead of looking at reports, <eob> he needs to walk down the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eol>
And instead of telling <eob> people what to do, <eol> he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is xxxxxxx change <eob> for <eob> someone who used to xx <eol> a master of <eob>
But in the xxx world, this executive # said, <eob> "I only had the illusion xx control.
In reality, many projects would <eol> over time and xxxx budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have xxxx more <eob> and # I can course-correct <eol> much if needed".
And middle <eol> need to change as well.
First xx all, without the handovers <eol> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx <eol> for middle managers. <eol>
And in the world, there was <eob> idea of thinkers # and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eol>
But now, instead of # only <eob> xxxxx <eol> people, <eol> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches. <eol>
So imagine, for the 10 <eob> you have # just been telling <eol> xxxxxx what to do, <eob> but now # you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eol> and some great leave the xxxxxxxx <eob>
But the <eob> result is # a new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And xxx this is hard work.
But it's worth <eol>
The that I worked # with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product a few times per year. <eob>
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eol> and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the <eob> whole # organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if walk the halls xx <eob> these companies today, <eob> you just a # energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, these companies, <eob> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet. <eol>
But at least with this new model, <eol> they are much better prepared to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx <eob> so we need <eol> reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest of that <eol> is not in structure <eob> or xxxxxxx or procedure, and it's also not just <eol> senior # executives xxxxxx charge. <eol>
Leaders will be all of in the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eol>
xx all # have xx lead change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are willing to give up? <eol>
Thank you. <eob>

And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The went viral, <eol> xxx at xxxxx it was pure xxxx <eob>
I started getting these incredible messages from people <eob> about how happy it made them, <eol> how encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, maybe this is the time to tell that <eob> little in my # head to just <eol> xxxx up <eob> let # myself be me. <eob>
But then <eol> things got a little # too big. <eol>
Carrie Dragshaw was xxxxxxxxxx xx In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eol> and I got terrified: <eol> "What # would my bosses <eob>
xxxxx # my coworkers <eol> still <eob> xxxxxxx me xx a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I # thought was going to <eob> have to <eol> a different job.
But then, something happened, something small. <eob>
I got <eob> a text from my boss, <eol> it wasn't long, just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" With # a xxxx xx xx article <eol> that had just gone about me. <eob>

Maybe that's you, maybe xx isn't. <eob>
But all xx this has taught me so much <eol> about just <eob> the importance <eol> of bringing your whole # self to xxxxx <eob>

they are in RVs <eol> or traveling xxxxxxx Airbnbs, xxxx are xx new places <eob> every day, week or month. <eob>
As xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally.
It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> from the <eob> very beginning. <eol>
Notice I don't <eob> the word "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eol> that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't.
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, where everyone is on <eob> # an playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed # workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eob> xx build a # company. <eob>
The xxx is you have to <eol> approach it consciously. <eol>
When we <eob> started WordPress, many the # first 20 hires <eol> were xxxxxx I'd never met in person.
But <eob> we'd collaborated xxxxxxx <eob> sometimes for <eob> years. <eol>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eob> throughout the <eob> world. But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the tech # companies fish from essentially the same small pond or # bay. <eob>
x distributed xxxxxxx <eob> can fish from xxx entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring <eob> someone # <eol> grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in <eol> you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, wakes up and # goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> xxxx bring a different <eob> understanding of culture <eol> and a different lived experience.
At the base of <eol> to go distributed, <eob> xxxxxxx a desire to give people autonomy over xxx <eob> they <eol> # do their work. <eol>
Unless you're in a role where hours are important, <eob> you # can # your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have corner office, their windows, the # <eob> food they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You xxx what temperature the room should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eol> and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # workforce <eob> xx xxxxx for x technology company. <eob>
But people <eob> often me, <eob> works great for xxxxxx <eol> but what about everyone else?" If you # have an office, <eob> you do a things <eol> to <eob> build xxxxxxxxxxx capability.
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In <eob> an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in # moment, <eol> in # the kitchen, # the <eol>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team are having conversations <eob> don't have <eob> xxxxxxx see these decisions made <eob> without understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave a trail where you were <eol> and what # you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to # pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows in <eob> # time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, <eol> people and xxxxxx <eob>
Try to have # much # communication as possible online. <eol>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> xx # allows # new people to catch up <eob>
You also need <eol> to find the tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how you probably # aren't <eob> objects anymore. <eob>
xxxxxx you <eob> access through your computer. <eob>
So experiment xxxx different tools that enable <eob> see <eol> what <eol> xxxxxx <eob>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time. <eob>
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place weeks out of xxx <eob> year and you might have <eol> three or four weeks <eob>
We xxx <eob> to that: we come # together <eol> for <eol> short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a <eob> grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eol> comes together a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eol> We # want to make # sure <eol> everyone's <eob> aligned and on same page, <eob> and they have a deeper <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they xxxx together <eol> the rest of the year, they can <eol> bring xxxxxxxx <eol> that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And # the final practice: <eob> give people the <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> xxxx they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eol> or just to buy coffee, so don't <eol> get <eob> kicked out # of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle decided <eob> pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a workspace on <eob> a pier. <eol>
Each <eol> xxxxxx who <eol> the company gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This <eol> is # money they can invest <eob> xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so can have <eol> the most <eol> productive environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are <eol> distributed first. <eob>
In <eol> a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict # that # <eob> 90 # percent of companies <eob> that are going to be <eol> the course of the # world <eob> are going to function this <eob>
They <eob> will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you think xxxxx xxxx you're going to build next, consider how you can tap <eol> into global <eol> xxxxxxx give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eol> xxxxx # <eob> they feel they xxxxxx <eol> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eob> it is that you're creating together. <eob>
