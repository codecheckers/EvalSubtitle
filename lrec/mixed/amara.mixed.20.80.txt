Imagine waking up a stranger -- <eol> sometimes multiple strangers questioning your right to existence for something that you online, <eol> waking up to # an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome # to the world of cyberharassment.
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women <eol> face xx Pakistan is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes deadly <eob>
This xxxx of harassment keeps women from accessing xxx internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's <eol> a form of oppression. <eol>
is xxx sixth most populous <eol> country the world, <eob> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access <eob> to <eob> technologies, and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx number <eob> doesn't xxxx # go down <eol> with xxx <eob> rise new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is # also the birthplace <eob> of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, Malala Yousafzai.
But that's <eol> just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eol>
xxxxxxx aspect is # where <eol> the twisted concept of <eol> honor is linked # to <eob> women and # their bodies; <eol> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eol> even kill them sometimes the name so-called "family honor"; <eob> where xxxxx # are <eob> left # to die right outside their houses for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, <eol> in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eol> it's # xxx honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eol>
I come from a small village in # Punjab, Pakistan, <eol> where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education. <eol>
The # elders of # <eol> my family <eol> allow women to pursue # their higher <eob> education <eol> or xxxxx careers.
However, unlike the other <eob> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father # was # one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, of course, # it <eob> was really <eob> difficult, <eob> and [there were] <eob> frowns of
But in xxx end, I knew <eob> it's either me xx them, chose myself.
(Applause) <eob>
My xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and for a <eol> woman <eol> wouldn't allow <eob> me to <eol> own x <eob> mobile <eob> until x was married. <eob>
And even I was married, <eol> this tool # became a tool for my xxx surveillance.
xxxx I resisted this idea <eol> of surveilled my <eob> ex-husband, he really didn't <eol> approve # of this <eob> and threw me # out of # his house, along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was <eob> # the time when I first asked myself, "Why? <eol>
are women not # allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
While the law states x xxxxx <eol> has # the same equal to the # information, <eol> why <eob> is <eob> it always men -- # brothers, fathers and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So <eob> to take <eob> # a step, <eol> instead of # keep questioning <eob> these patriarchal <eob> and societal norms. <eol>
And I the Digital Rights <eob> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to the issues <eol> and # women's experiences <eob> in online spaces and # cyberharassment. <eob>
lobbying <eol> xxx free and safe internet <eob> xx convincing young women that to the safe xxxxxxxx <eob> is their fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my part <eol> in igniting # the spark <eol> to address # <eob> the questions <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eob>
With a <eol> xxxx in my heart, and to offer a solution to this <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's and the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eol> in December xxxx -- <eob> (Applause) <eol>
to extend my support to # the women <eob> who do xxx know who to turn to <eob> when they xxxx xxxxxxx threats online.
I think of the women # who do <eol> not # have <eob> the necessary support to # deal with the mental trauma <eob> when they # feel <eol> unsafe in online spaces, <eol> and they go about daily <eob> xxxxxxxx that is <eol> x rape threat in their in-box. <eob>

(Applause) <eob>
at # critical moment.
Our leaders, of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # failing <eol>
Why?
In # some <eob> cases, # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eob> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
And this # is unacceptable. <eob>
This has to <eob>
How are going to correct <eob> these wrongs? <eol>
xxx are we # <eob> xxxxx <eol> to xxxxxx the right course? <eol>
It's not <eob> going to be easy. <eol>
For I've worked with <eob> talented teams and they've <eob> # chosen the right objectives <eol> and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of # them have <eob>
And today # # to share with xxx <eob> what # really makes x <eol> xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eol> how xxx why <eol> they <eob> set meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to # 1975.
Yep, this # # me. <eob>
I've got a xxx to learn, <eol> I'm a computer engineer, I've got long # hair, <eol> but # I'm # working <eol> under Andy Grove, who's been called the # greatest manager <eob> of his or any # other era. <eob>
Andy was # a superb and also a teacher, and he said # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most".
And so <eol> Andy # a system called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx # kind of rolls off <eob> xxx tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
xxx it's all about excellent
So a classic video from <eol> the 1970s <eol> of Andy xxxxxx
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eob> management by objective systems <eob> are the # objectives and the key results, <eob> and they match the two <eob> purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx key <eob> results have to be measured, but at the end you can # look and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I not that?" <eol> No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. <eol> Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, <eob> or <eob> OKRs, <eol> are a # simple goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and they # work for organizations, <eol> they <eob> work teams, <eob> they even work for individuals. <eol>
are what <eol> want to have accomplished. <eob>
key results are how <eol> I'm going xx get that done. <eol>
Objectives. Key results. <eol>
What and how.
But here's the truth: xxxx of us are goals wrong, and most xx <eob> us <eol> are not setting goals at all.
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and # meet them. <eol>
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their <eol> numbers, <eob> but they lack a sense of purpose <eol> to xxxxxxx their teams. <eol>
So # xxx do you set these <eob> goals the xxxxx way?
First, must answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eol>
Because truly transformational teams <eol> combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their # passion and to their # purpose, <eol> they develop a clear <eob> and compelling # <eob> sense of why. <eob>
x want to tell you # a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name is Jini Kim.
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
is # health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded, <eol> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs of lots of workers # at large companies.
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, the government issued a proposal to build the xxxxx ever <eob> cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll # <eol> that Medicaid is <eob> that # program <eob> that <eob> serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our # xxxxx our children and people with disabilities. <eol>
Nuna the time was # just 15 <eol> people <eob> and this database <eob> had to be built in <eob> one year, <eob> and # they had a set of commitments xxxx <eol> they <eol> xxx to honor, <eob> and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money xx the project.
xxxx xxx a <eol> bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it.
She jumped at the opportunity. She did not flinch. <eob>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal why.
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eob>
And he was seven, he had his # xxxxx grand mal <eob> seizure at Disneyland.
He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents Korean <eol> # immigrants. <eol>
They came # to the # country <eol> xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was <eol> nine # years old.
That moment defined her mission, <eol> and that mission became <eob> her company, xxx that company bid on, won <eob> and delivered on that xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxx Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family from <eol> bankruptcy, <eol> and # today it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and <eol> for millions others. <eol>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of xxxx # a life <eol> whose <eob> story deserves <eob> with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob> are <eol> inspiring, and <eob> they're kind of xxxxxxx <eob> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think # a rockstar would be unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eol> to wage <eol> a global xxx <eol> against poverty # and xxxxxxxx <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has <eob> xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eob> audacious objectives.
The <eob> # is xxxx relief <eob> for the poorest xxxxxxxxx <eol> in # the world. <eol>
The next xxxxxxxxx access <eol> anti-HIV drugs. <eol>
Now, why are these good <eob>
xxxxx xx back to <eob> # our checklist. <eob>
Check. # Concrete? Yes.
Action-oriented? Yes. <eol>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate?
What actions does # your passion <eol> lead xxx to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eol> a rhyme # <eob> with the # head, <eob> then your passion means nothing.
# OKR framework cultivates <eob> the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for <eob> risk, <eol> for trust, where failing not a fireable <eob> offense.
And when you have that sort <eob> xx structure and environment <eob> and <eob> the right people, <eol> magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx and magic is right around the # corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eol>
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, <eob> xxxx Bono the # whats # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn # <eol> attention the xxxxx <eob>
Remember, the hows the key results. <eob> That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eob> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eol>
Those are good key results.
In <eol> 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry <eob> # and Sergey. <eob>
Here <eol> they 24 years old in their garage.
And Sergey enthusiastically <eob> said he'd <eol> adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite.
What he really # said was, <eob> "We any other to manage this company, <eob> so it a go". <eol> (Laughter) <eob>
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eol> every Googler <eob> has # written down <eob> her objectives and her key <eob>
They've <eob> graded them, <eol> and <eob> they've <eob> xxxxxxxxx # them <eol> for everyone to <eob>
And these are <eol> not used for <eob> bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They're <eob> # set <eob> aside. <eob>
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's # get <eob> xxxxxxxxxx commitment to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, <eob> Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eob> the xxxx generation client platform for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> -- in other words, build xxx browser. <eol>
He was very xxxxxxxxxx about how # he chose his key results. <eob>
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> xxxxxxx users are going # to decide if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not. <eol>
So he this # one <eol> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eob>
And <eob> then every <eob> year he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the <eol> ante. <eol>
In first <eol> year, his # was 20 million <eol> users <eol> and he missed it.
He less xxxx 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million.
He got to <eol> 37 million users.
xxxxxxxx better.
In the # third year, <eob> he upped the ante once xxxx <eol> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He <eob> # launched an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eob> improved <eob> xxx technology, and kaboom!
He got 111 <eob> # million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this # story, <eol> xxx so much for the happy but it someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it year after year after year. <eob>
It's x perfect <eol> story for nerd me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eob> as vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eob> and <eol> hows of our ambitions. <eob>
really matters <eob> is # the xxx <eol> that xx pour xxxx those vessels. <eob>
That's <eob> why we do our <eob> work. <eol>
are x <eol> silver # bullet.
They're not going to # <eob> a substitute <eob> a strong culture <eob> or for leadership, <eol> but # when those # fundamentals are # in place, <eol> they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eol>
I <eob> # want you # <eob> to # think about your life for a moment. <eol>
Do you # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write # down <eol> your values, <eob> your objectives and <eob> your key results. <eob>
xx it today. <eob>
If # like some feedback on them, <eol> you # can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of <eob> xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eol> they're remarkable: ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx affordable health <eol> care, <eol> high-quality for # everyone, <eol> ending global poverty, <eob> access to xxx the world's information.
Here's the deal: <eol> every one of those <eol> goals <eob> is powered xxxxx by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've been called <eol> the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs for spreading good gospel <eol> according <eol> # to Andy xxxxxx <eol> but I want you to join xx <eol> # in this # movement. <eob>
Let's fight what it is <eob> xxxx really # matters, <eob> because we can # take OKRs beyond our businesses. <eol>
# can take them to <eob> our families, <eob> to our schools, <eol> even to # our governments. <eob>
We can xxxx those <eol> # governments accountable. <eol>
We can <eob> transform <eol> # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track <eol> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eob>
Thank <eol>

What is history? <eob>
It is something written by the winners. <eol>
is a stereotype that <eob> history <eob> should be <eol> focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, <eol> people <eol> in countries, like <eob> mine, Russia, <eol> look at as something <eol> that was or determined <eob> xx leaders, <eol> and common people could <eob> xxx <eob> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eob> that xxxxxx <eol> could ever xxxx been <eol> or ever <eob> will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx <eob> is xxx to the way history has xxxx <eob> framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And this <eob> is true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two # <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to <eob> the year 1917, the year xx <eob> the Russian Revolution.
x asked myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
So last year, <eob> we built <eol> a # social network xxx dead people, <eob> named <eob> Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded all possible real diaries and letters <eol> written by <eob> more <eol> than 3,000 people <eol> 100 # years ago. <eob>
So any user of our <eob> website # xx application <eol> follow a feed <eob> xxx each day of 1917 <eol> and read what people like <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova and others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities <eob> being ordinary people like <eob> # you xxx me, <eob> not # demigods, <eob> and <eob> we see that history consists of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, weaknesses, <eol> not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxx project was x shock for <eob> many xxxxxxxxx who used <eob> to <eob> think <eob> that our country has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and <eol> the ideas of freedom and democracy could never have prevailed, <eol> just because democracy xxx xxx our destiny. <eob>
But we take a broader look, <eob> it's not that black and white. <eob>
1917 # led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But xxxx this # <eob> project, we see # that Russia <eol> could # <eob> have had a <eol> different history <eol> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, as <eol> # any other country could or still can.
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eob> you learn that xxxxxx was first country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one the first ones <eol> to grant women <eob> voting <eol> rights. <eob>
Knowing # history and understanding xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eol> can help # us create a future, <eol> because <eob> history <eob> is xxxx a rehearsal of what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eol>
We do need new ways of telling history, and this xxxxx for example, <eol> we started a # xxx online project <eol> that called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary that gives you an impression of that xxxxx a year marked by global social change <eob> that, many ways, <eob> xxxxxxx the <eob> world as know it now. <eob>
But we are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all # the main <eol> could use mobile phones # ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see that x lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eob> and were fighting the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR or France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eob> in such a democratic way, <eob> through # social media, we show that people xx power are <eob> not the only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives <eol> # any user <eob> a possibility of reclaiming <eob> history. <eob>
people matter.
They have <eob> an <eob> impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eob>
We shape
We all make history. <eob>

algorithms today <eob> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence. <eob>
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eol> is often referred to xx AI or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx on our lives in the # future.
Today, <eob> # however, we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several # <eol> life-threatening illnesses, <eol> such as infectious diseases xxx cancer. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx of every <eob> lose their # lives due to liver and # oral cancer. <eob>
Our xxxx way xx help these patients is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases.
So how xx we these diseases today, <eob> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eob> an expert physician xxxxx # orders <eol> very expensive medical xxxxxxx technologies <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, <eob> CTs, MRIs, # <eol> to <eob> be performed. <eol>
Once those <eob> images are # collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images <eob> and talks to the patient. <eob>
As you can <eob> see, this is a very process, <eol> requiring both expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies, and is considered <eol> practical <eob> for the # developing world. <eol>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can # we this using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve this problem, I would require 10,000 -- <eol> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eob> these very expensive medical # first to be generated. <eol>
After that, I would then # # an # expert physician, <eob> who <eol> would then analyze <eob> those images for <eol>
And # using those two <eob> pieces xx information, <eol> I <eob> can train a standard deep <eob> neural network xx deep learning <eob> network <eob> to <eob> provide patient's # diagnosis.
Similar to the xxxxx approach, <eob> traditional # <eol> intelligence approaches <eol> suffer from <eob> the same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> xxx # expert medical imaging technologies. <eol>
So, can we invent more <eob> scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx xxxxxxxx artificial intelligence architectures <eob> to solve <eol> these very <eol> problems facing today? <eob>
And <eol> this is exactly what my group at MIT Media xxx does.
We have invented # a variety <eol> of unorthodox # AI architectures <eob> to solve some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical # trials. <eob>
In # the example I shared <eol> with you today, <eol> we <eob> had two goals. <eol>
Our first <eol> goal was to reduce <eol> xxx number of images required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms.
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more ambitious, <eol> xx wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies to <eol> screen patients. <eol>
So how we # do it? <eol>
For <eol> our first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and thousands <eol> of these very # expensive images, <eol> like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eol> we started a single medical image. <eob>
From this # image, my team and x figured out a very clever way to extract billions of information # packets. <eol>
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included xxxxxxx pixels, geometry and rendering xx <eol> the disease xx the medical image. <eol>
In x sense, we converted # <eob> one <eol> into billions of training data points, <eol> massively reducing the # amount <eol> of data <eob> needed xxx training.
For our second xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the use <eob> expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eob> white light photograph, <eol> acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile phone, for <eol> the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information # packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from xxx medical image onto this <eol> creating something <eol> that we call a composite image.
Much to our <eob> we only required 50 -- <eob> I repeat, # xxxx # 50 # -- <eob> of composite images <eob> to train xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies. <eol>
To summarize xxx approach, <eob> instead of using <eol> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the AI <eol> in an # <eob> unorthodox way, <eob> using # only # 50 of these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> xxx xxxxxx phones, and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our <eol> algorithms can # accept, <eob> in the future and even right now, <eob> some # very simple, # white light <eol> photographs from patient, <eol> of # expensive medical imaging <eol> # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I believe that <eob> we are # poised <eob> to enter <eob> an # <eob> where artificial # intelligence <eob> is to <eob> make an xxxxxxxxxx impact # on our xxxxxxx <eob>
I think that xxxxxxxx <eob> about traditional AI, which <eob> data-rich but application-poor, xx should <eol> also continue # thinking about <eol> unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence architectures, which can accept # small xxxxxxx # <eol> of data <eol> and solve some of <eol> the most important <eol> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx <eob> especially in xxxxxx # care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eol>

What if could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, like getting # over a cold, <eob> you could your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, xx we have <eob> an <eol> operation or # xx accident, <eob> we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars <eol> and painful <eob> side effects <eob> of our regenerate <eol> or regrow <eol> healthy, uninjured organs.
I xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that <eob> instruct our immune <eob> system xx give <eob> the signals to grow new <eob> tissues. <eob>
like vaccines instruct <eob> our body to fight disease, <eob> we could instead instruct <eob> our immune system <eol> to build tissues <eol> and <eob> quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body <eob> parts out of nowhere <eob> might seem like magic, but there are several # organisms that <eol> can achieve this <eob> feat.
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eob> can completely regenerate their arm, and <eob> # even us mere <eol> can # regrow our liver after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass.
To make xxxx magic <eob> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can wounds # <eol> and build # tissue <eol> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eol> xxx immune system defends <eol> our # body from danger.
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know <eob> about our body's <eol> defense system, <eob> I was able to <eob> key players in our fight to build back xxx cuts and bruises. <eob>
xxxx looking at materials <eob> that are currently # being tested for their abilities to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured xxxx these materials, <eob> xxxxx was <eob> a large number of immune xxxxx <eol> in xxxx material <eol> and the surrounding muscle. <eol>
xx in this <eob> case, <eob> instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off <eob> towards infection fight bacteria, <eol> they're rushing toward # an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eol> type of xxxxxx cell, the <eob> helper T cell, was present inside <eob> material that I implanted <eob> xxx absolutely critical for wound healing. <eob>
Now, just like <eol> when you were x kid <eol> and # you'd break your pencil <eol> try # and tape it back together again, can # <eob> heal, <eob> but # <eol> it might not be # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll xxx a scar. <eob>
So if # we xxxxx have these helper T cells, <eol> instead <eol> of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat <eol> # cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's <eol> fat in <eob> our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx as # strong.
Now, using <eol> our immune system, <eob> our body could grow back without these scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we <eob> were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials <eob> that give <eob> us the signals <eol> to <eob> build new tissue <eob> xx changing the immune <eob>
We know that any time a material # implanted in our # body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eol>
This ranges xxxx pacemakers to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials # that engineers are using <eol> xx try and new <eob>
xx when # I <eob> xxxxx that material, <eol> or # scaffold, in body, the immune creates <eob> small environment cells and proteins that change the xxx <eol> that our stem cells <eol> behave. <eol>
just like the # weather <eob> affects our # daily activities, like # going for a run or staying and <eol> entire TV show # Netflix, <eob> immune of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that <eob> our stem cells grow and develop.
If we have the wrong signals, say the signals, <eob> we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds # are <eob> of a different things, <eob> plastics to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> sponges that are or less porous, <eob> gels of stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals time. <eol>
xx other # words, we can <eol> orchestrate <eob> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed # different <eob> just <eob> like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm specific types of signals that mimic # how our body responds to injury <eol> to help us regenerate.
In # the future, # we see <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx a # <eob> muscle filler <eob> or even a wound-healing vaccine.
Now, we aren't <eob> going to xxxx up tomorrow <eol> and be able xx heal # like Wolverine.
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, <eol> and # working <eol> with our immune system <eob> to build tissue and heal <eob> wounds, <eob> we could begin seeing <eol> products <eol> on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help <eol> us regenerate, <eol> and maybe one day be able <eob> xx keep pace with a salamander. <eol>
Thank you.

as a child, <eob> I used spend all of <eol> at my <eob> great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, humid, days, <eol> x would dash xxxxxx # floor xxx <eob> stick my face in # front of her <eol> only air conditioner.
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, though # was a privileged <eol> one in # our community. <eol>
Growing up, stories of <eob> having to set up fake energy accounts or having to <eob> steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me.
During # the winter, struggling to <eob> get warm, <eol> my neighbors would have no choice <eol> xx bypass the meter <eob> after their heat shut off, <eol> xxxx to <eob> keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day. <eol>
xxxxx of dangerous incidents <eob> xxx take root <eob> when people # are faced <eob> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on # energy. <eob>
In # contrast, # low-income <eol> and xxxxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # spend 20, 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy.
In xxxxx # this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eob> to provide # power to their homes. <eol>
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are xx much more <eol> than just a number.
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # you take child <eob> get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you <eol> feed her?
Or do you keep warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eol> and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eob> between medicine and energy. <eol>
This exposes a much larger and # systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high # energy burdens <eob> are <eob> disproportionately people of color, <eol> who spend more per square foot than their white # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, <eob> and even schoolteachers who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx million people a year <eol> who are <eol> unable to afford energy <eob> for their most needs. <eol>
As a result, those xxxx xxxx energy burdens have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma. <eob>
Look -- # given rockets to Mars and our pocket-sized # <eol> we <eol> have the xxxxx to address these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is <eol>
Cost <eob> xx renewables, <eol> insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology <eol> are all decreasing. <eob>
even as we approach cost xxxxxxx <eol> the majority of xxxxx who own solar earn much more than the average American. <eol>
This is why, # when I was 22, <eol> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by # with # communities, utilities and # government agencies alike to provide equitable <eob> access to clean energy, <eol> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eol>
But there's no one way to solve this. <eol>
I believe the power <eol> of local # communities, <eob> in the <eob> transforming effect <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So start <eol> by working directly with the communities <eol> xxxx have the highest energy <eol> burdens. <eol>
We host <eob> workshops <eob> and events for communities <eob> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eob> and making even small updates to their homes <eob> like better insulation windows <eob> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting # <eol> xx community solar <eol> and xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx smart home research <eol> and installation # <eob> programs to help families <eol> their # bills.
We're even working # xxxxxxxx with xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because <eol> to <eol> see this vision <eob> of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eol> we xxxx to # work together sustainably. <eol>
Now, xxx # US spends over <eol> three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do help <eob> millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only <eob> able to help fraction of # those in need. <eol>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, so assistance alone is not <eob>
But by <eob> building energy equity and # <eob> resilience into our <eob> communities, we can assure fair and impartial access to that <eob> is clean, <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At scale, # microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and efficiency dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eol>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, it xxx help them reclaim 20 # their <eol> income -- <eob> 20 percent of a # person's income who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eol>
This is # life-changing. <eol>
This is an opportunity <eol> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eob> to xxxxxxx their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eob> and xxx neighbors, <eob> the impossible <eol> that <eol> they # xxx # to make <eob> and xxx # effect # <eol> our whole xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this # is not just about # them. <eob>
There # are xxxxxxxx <eob> nationwide having to make the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eol> xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx but # through <eob> relationships <eol> with communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them.
And when we <eob> do, <eol> we will # <eob> all be <eob> more resilient. <eol>

Have ever a flock of <eob> birds work together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, flying in <eol> perfect synchrony: Isn't it <eol> fascinating?
xxxx I find remarkable is that these birds <eob> would not be able to do that <eob> if they # all would have to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction <eob> # speed <eol> would simply be too low.
Instead, scientists believe <eob> that these birds are aligned on <eol> x few simple rules, allowing every single bird <eol> to make autonomous decisions <eob> while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eol>
alignment enables their autonomy, <eol> and their autonomy <eob> xxxxx them xxxx and flexible.
xxxx what does this have to do <eol> with any one of <eob> # us?
Well, it's one # of xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eob> that <eob> is needed in ways of working # today.
The world getting faster and more complex, <eol> so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx <eol> a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: In <eob> order to <eob> get there, <eob> what are we <eol> willing to give xxx <eob>
few years ago, # I was working with a <eol> wanted to embark <eob> on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
They # wanted # xxxxx offering to be simpler, <eol> intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many you <eol> have seen a bank from the # inside, <eob> so # let me <eob> try to illustrate <eob> xxxx many <eob> traditional banks look like.
You see lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to go to their # department, marketers # sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers with engineers, etc.
You see meetings with xx people <eol> where nothing <eob> gets decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They end up <eol> xx <eol> PowerPoint xxxxxxx <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
anything # done xxx take forever.
So this bank knew <eob> that in order to # transform, they would have to improve <eol> # to market by drastically <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> their ways xx as well.
xxx how?
To get some inspiration, we <eob> decided <eol> to # <eob> go and have a look at # companies <eol> # seem to be more innovative, <eol> xxxx Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos.
And I remember # how we xxxx walking the xxxxx <eob> at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx <eob> x management consultant <eol> and a xxxx of <eob> # bankers. <eob>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eob> surrounded # beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots # of # xxxxxx creative employees. <eol>
So then <eob> we asked, <eob> "How is your company organized?" <eob> we expected xx # <eob> get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eol> funny names like # "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and "tribes" # explain they <eob> were organized. <eob>
So then we tried to xxxxxxxxx that to our # own world. <eob>
We asked, "How people <eol> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do <eob> you <eob> report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides your priorities?" "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise.
We were # asking # for what we thought were some # of the <eol> basic principles of organizations, <eol> and their answer xxxx "It depends". <eob>
Now, <eob> over the course <eob> of that xxxx <eol> xx gained a better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of <eob> their <eob> model. <eob>
They believed in # power <eol> of small, teams.
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.
xxxx had product people <eob> and # IT engineers in the same team <eol> so they <eob> could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eol> independently of # others in the # company.
They did not need handovers xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had all the skills needed right there # in the team. <eol>
Now, at # the end of that day, we had a session <eol> to reflect xx <eob> what we had learned. <eob>
And xx had started to like their model, xx we were already thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # bank.
But xxxxx # one of the hosts, a guy who had not said a word all day, he suddenly said, <eol> "So I see like our # model. <eob>
But # I have one question for you: <eob> What # are willing to give up?" What were <eob> we willing to give up?
We did <eol> not have xx answer immediately, <eol> but we <eol> knew he was right. <eob>
xxxxxx is xxx about <eol> embracing the new; it's about giving up <eol> on some # of the old as #
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I # have # worked <eob> with companies all over the world to change their xxxx # of working. <eol>
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own skeptics <eob> about why this not <eol> going work # xxx them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> xx "They # have the # legacy <eol> IT like we xxxx or "Regulators # just won't <eob> this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for xxxx bank and <eob> also for the other companies <eob> that I worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we # completely <eol> blew <eol> up # the old silos <eol> between <eob> marketing, <eol> xxxxxxxx channels and IT. <eob>
Three # <eob> employees xxxx # into # 350 teams. <eol>
So instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with product <eob> # people <eob> and engineers <eob> with engineers, a # product # <eob> person and an engineer <eob> were now members of the same <eol>
You could be a member of a <eob> team <eob> responsible for account opening <eob> or the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> that # new organization, <eob> some people xxxxxxx hands <eob> for the very first time, <eob> to # find out that they # had been sitting two # away from each other <eob> but they xxxx sending each # other emails <eob> and status reports for the last 10 # years. <eol>
You would hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, so you're <eob> the guy # that # I <eol> was always chasing xxx answers". <eol>
But they're <eol> every day. <eol>
xx the <eob> product guy xxx an idea, <eol> xx can just raise to get input the engineer xxx sitting right next # to # him. <eol>
They can to test <eob> with customers <eob> immediately -- no handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx no red xxxxx <eob> xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eol>
Now, getting there is # not # easy. <eob>
xxx # as it turns out, <eol> xxxxx are you willing to give up?" <eob> is exactly the # right question to ask.
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
of decisions up and <eol> down the organization, <eob> we want the team to decide.
But to xx so, we need <eol> all the # and expertise for that # decision <eol> in <eob> the team. <eol>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eol>
Can we physically co-locate our people are working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or different countries today? <eob>
Or <eob> should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing?
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in <eol> the way # we do things <eol> across these <eob>
We still some kind <eob> of management <eol>
Now, all these changes structure process and procedure -- <eob> xxxx # are not <eob>
in the end, <eol> I found that the # most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> xx our own xxxxxxxxx
Let me # <eol> try to <eol> illustrate. <eol>
we # want these teams to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, like a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eol>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eob> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when # to do, how to do. <eob>
No <eob> micromanagers. <eol>
it <eol> also means that each <eob> xxxxx to # become a <eol> leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # <eob> title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative.
Now # obviously, we also # cannot afford <eol> to have # all teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> xxxxxxx that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So <eol> we xxxxxxxxx and autonomy at the same time, <eol> just a flock of <eol>
In an <eol> organizational setting, <eol> requires new behaviors, <eol> and with each new behavior, <eob> there # is giving up on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to # <eob> make sure <eob> xxxx # everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around the overall -- # the <eob> why -- <eol> overall <eol> priorities -- the what. <eol>
then they have to let # go <eol> and trust # their # teams <eob> to make the right decisions <eol> on how to get # there. <eol>
Now, creating alignment requires <eob> open and transparent communication. <eol>
But you how they say that <eob> information # is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, <eob> sharing <eob> information may # feel as <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
it's <eob> not just managers.
xxx teams need to communicate <eob> openly and transparently well.
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx teams <eol> typically work # in short <eol> sprints, <eob> and at <eob> the # end of every sprint, <eob> they organize a demo session <eob> share the output what they've <eob> transparently.
And every <eob> each # member of the gives # <eol> an update of what they are # working on individually.
Now, all <eol> this transparency can xx uncomfortable people, <eob> because there <eob> xx <eol> no place to # hide anymore.
Everything we do <eob> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone. <eob>
So, # is not easy, <eob> providing autonomy <eob> not xx obvious, either.
One executive at another <eob> company <eob> likes to explain xxx he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, # today, to know <eob> how things # are # going, <eob> instead of looking at reports, he needs to walk down the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, <eol> he looks <eob> for ways to help them.
That is xxxxxxx change <eob> for someone who used to xx <eol> a master <eol> of <eob>
But in the xxx <eol> world, this executive # <eol> said, "I only had the illusion xx control.
In reality, many projects would <eob> over time and xxxx budget, <eob> anyway. <eob>
Now I have xxxx more <eol> and # I can course-correct <eob> much if needed".
And middle need <eob> to change <eob> as well.
First xx all, without the handovers <eob> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the world, there was <eol> idea of thinkers # and doers. <eol>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of # only <eol> xxxxx people, <eob> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eol> become player-coaches.
So imagine, for the 10 <eob> you have # just been telling <eob> xxxxxx what to do, but <eol> now # you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eob> and some great leave the xxxxxxxx <eob>
But the result is # a <eob> new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And xxx <eob> this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth <eob>
The that I worked # with, they were used to deploying new product a few times per <eol> year. <eol>
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eol> and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole # <eob> organization <eob> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if walk the halls <eol> xx these companies today, <eob> you <eob> just a # energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, <eob> these companies, <eol> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, <eol> they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world <eob> is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx so we need reboot our way of working. <eol>
And the hardest of that <eob> is not <eob> in structure <eol> or <eob> xxxxxxx or procedure, <eol> and it's also not just senior # <eob> executives xxxxxx charge. <eol>
Leaders will <eob> be all of <eob> in the organization <eol> who embrace the change. <eol>
xx all # have xx lead change. <eob>
So the <eob> question is: <eob> What are willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

[The Way Work] <eob> My is Dan, I'm x partner <eol> at a global <eol> creative consultancy. <eob>

And then, things got crazy. <eob>
The went viral, <eol> xxx at <eol> xxxxx it was <eol> pure xxxx <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eob> messages from people <eol> about how happy it made them, how encouraged them <eol> to be <eob> their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, <eol> maybe this is the time to tell that little in my # head to just xxxx up let # myself be me. <eol>
But then things got a little # too big.

As xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, <eob> we don't care where they are. <eol>
Our focus on distributed work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eol>
It was <eob> a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob> from <eob> the very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't the word "remote," because it sets up the expectation, that some people are essential <eob> and some aren't. <eol>
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to <eob> describe what we do, where everyone is <eol> on # an playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed # workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eol> xx build a <eob> # company. <eol>
The xxx is you have to <eob> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many the # <eob> first 20 hires <eol> were xxxxxx I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx <eob> sometimes for years. <eol>
wanted to continue # xxxx <eol> for # simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eob> But opportunity is <eob> not. <eol>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> the tech # companies <eob> fish <eol> from essentially the same small pond <eob> or # bay. <eob>
x distributed <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> can fish <eol> from xxx entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring someone # grew up in Japan but lives in <eob> you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and # <eob> goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in the world. xxxx bring a different <eob> understanding of culture <eol> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base <eob> of <eol> to go <eol> distributed, <eob> xxxxxxx a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over xxx they # do their work.
Unless you're in a role <eol> where hours are important, you # can # your own schedule. <eol>
Everyone can have corner office, <eob> their windows, the # <eob> food they <eob> want to <eol> eat, you can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eol>
You xxx what temperature <eob> the room <eob> should be. <eob>
You <eol> can save the <eob> time you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eob> workforce xx xxxxx for x technology company.
But people often me, works great for xxxxxx but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you # have an <eob> office, <eob> you do a things <eol> to <eob> build xxxxxxxxxxx capability. <eol>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy to make decisions in # moment, <eob> in # the kitchen, # the <eol>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team <eol> are having conversations don't have <eob> xxxxxxx see these decisions made <eob> without understanding <eol> the why. <eol>
Always leave a <eob> trail where <eob> you were <eol> and what # you <eob> were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to # pick up where you left off.
It allows in # <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great # to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, people and xxxxxx <eob>
Try to have # <eob> much # communication <eob> as possible online. <eol>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> xx <eol> # allows # new people to catch up <eob>
You <eob> also need <eob> to find the tools.
There are so many apps and services that help with day-to-day <eol> video <eob> conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that <eol> changed how you <eob> probably # aren't objects anymore. <eol>
xxxxxx you access through your computer. <eob>
So experiment xxxx <eob> different <eob> tools that enable see what xxxxxx
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place <eol> weeks out of xxx <eob> year <eol> and you might have three or <eob> four weeks
We xxx to that: we come # together <eol> for short, intense bursts. Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company comes together a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx We # want to make # sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on same page, <eob> and they have a deeper with their colleagues. <eob>
When they xxxx together <eob> the rest of the year, <eob> they can bring xxxxxxxx <eob> that understanding and <eol> empathy. <eob>
And # the final practice: <eol> give people the to make their own work environment. <eol>
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend xxxx <eob> they can put <eob> towards a co-working <eob> space or just to buy coffee, so don't <eol> get kicked out <eob> # of <eob> the coffee shop.
One group in Seattle <eol> decided pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a workspace on a pier. <eol>
Each xxxxxx who the company <eol> gets a home-office <eob> stipend.
This is # money they can invest xx getting the xxxxx chair, monitor, the right <eol> desk setup, so can <eob> have <eol> the most productive environment for them.
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict # that # <eob> 90 # percent of companies that are going to be the course of the # world are going to function this <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll <eol> be replaced by those that are.
As you think xxxxx <eob> xxxx you're going to build next, consider how you can tap <eol> into global xxxxxxx <eol> give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eob> xxxxx # they feel <eol> they xxxxxx still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eob> it is that you're creating together. <eol>
