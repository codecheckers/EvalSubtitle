Our second <eob> goal -- # xx were more <eol> xx # wanted to # the use <eol> of medical xxxxxxx technologies <eob> to xxxxxx <eob>
how did # we xx it?
For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead # xx starting <eol> tens and # thousands xx these very # expensive # medical like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started with a # xxxxxxx image.
From this xxxxxx my team # and # x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to <eob> # # billions <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx

xx # a xxxxxx we converted xxx # xxxxx <eol> into xxxxxxxx # of # xxxxxxxx # data <eob> massively # the amount of xxxx <eol> xxxxxx # for # training. <eob>
For our xxxxxx # xxxxx <eob> xx xxxxxx the <eol> # use <eol> # expensive medical <eol> technologies to screen patients, <eob> # with a xxxxxxxxx <eol> white light photograph, acquired xxxxxx xxxx camera <eol> or a # mobile # xxx xxx # xxxxxxxx <eob>
remember those <eol> billions # # information # packets? <eob>
We overlaid those # from <eol> xxx # # image this image, <eob> creating <eol> we # a image. <eob>
Much # to our <eol> xx only required xx -- <eob> repeat, xxxx 50 -- <eol> of # these xxxxxx to # <eol> our xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
To summarize # <eob> of xxxxx 10,000 <eol> very # expensive xxxxxxx can xxx xx algorithms <eob> in # an unorthodox way, <eob> # 50 of # these high-resolution, <eob> xxx <eob> from xxxx cameras <eob> xxx mobile xxxxxxx <eob> provide # xxxxxxxxxx
More # importantly, <eol> xxx # can # accept, <eol> in # the future # and even right xxxx <eob> some # xxxx xxxxxxx # white # <eol> photographs from xxx # patient, <eob> instead xx expensive <eol> medical # imaging technologies. <eob>

xx when I place xxxxxxxxx <eob> or scaffold, # in the body, <eob> the # xxxxxx # # xxxxxxx <eol> a small environment of cells # and proteins <eob> can # change the # way <eob> that our # stem # cells behave. <eob>
xxxx just like # xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> our daily activities, <eol> xxxx # run <eol> or # staying # inside binge-watching <eol> an entire xx show on Netflix, <eob> the immune # a xxxxxxxx <eob> affects xxx # way that <eol> our # xxxx cells xxx develop. <eol>

Now, xxxx # does # have # xx xx <eol> with any one xx # us? <eob>
Well, xxxx # one way xx what <eol> x to be the most change <eob> xxxx is needed in <eob> ways of working today.
The world is getting faster <eol> xxx complex, <eob> so xx xxxx a new # way # xx working, <eob> way that creates <eob> alignment around # purpose, <eob> xxxx xxxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and that xxxxx empowers <eol> xx # decisions <eob>
But xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> order to get there, <eol> what are # we willing xx # give # up? <eol>
A few ago, x was with x xxxx wanted to <eol> on x # <eol>
They wanted their to simpler, <eol> more more # relevant. <eob>
Now, xxx not xxx # many of # you <eol> have seen x from the # xxxxxxx <eob> so xx <eob> try # to illustrate <eob> what many traditional # banks xxxx like. <eob>
xxx <eol> see # lots xx # people suits <eob> taking elevators to # go <eol> to # department, <eob> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers with etc. <eob>
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people <eob> where gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
ideas? <eob> They end # up <eol> xx PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can take xxxxxxxx <eob>
So this bank knew <eob> xxxx in # # transform, <eob> xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx <eol> their time xx # market <eol> drastically changing <eol> their # # of # # xx well.
But <eol> how? <eob>
xx <eob> # get some xxxxxxx <eol> xx <eol> # xx and # # a look # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to xx more # innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos.
xxx I remember how # we # <eob> the # halls at # these companies <eob> xx # December 2014, <eob> a management # consultant <eol> and x # team of bankers. <eob>
xxxx # strangers # a strange # land, <eob> surrounded # <eob> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we # asked, <eol> "How xx your company organized?" <eob> And xx expected xx xxx xx org <eob>
xxx instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx drawings <eob> xxxx # funny xxxxx like # xxxxxxxx <eol> and "chapters" # "tribes" <eob> xx explain how were organized. <eob>
So then # we tried translate <eol> xxxx our # own world. <eol>
We asked, "How many xxxxxx are xxxxxxx # you?" <eob> # depends". <eob>
# do # report <eob>
"Who xxxxxxx on # priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You xxx # imagine # our <eob>
We # were # asking xxx <eol> some # the basic # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> of organizations, <eob> and answer xxxx xxx depends". <eol>
Now, course # <eob> of that xxxx <eob> gained # a # better <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their <eob>
They in xxx power <eol> xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups. <eob>
had # # people <eob> and # <eob> engineers # in the same team so they could # design, # build and test ideas # customers <eob> independently <eob> of others xx the company. <eob>
xxxx # did xxxx # <eol> handovers # <eob>
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed <eol> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, # at the of that <eol> x # session <eob> # reflect xx what xx had # learned. <eob>
# we xxx # started to # their # model, <eob> so xx were thinking of how xxxxx some of # these ideas xx a # xxxxx <eob>
But then, one # of hosts, <eob> a who said # a # all day, <eob> xx suddenly said, <eol> xxx you xxx xxxxxx
But x have one question you: <eob> What xxx willing # to # xxxx up?" <eob> xxxx xx xxxxxxx <eob> to <eol> # give up? <eob>
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, <eol> but # we xxxx he was right. <eob>
# xx not # only <eol> embracing the <eob> it's about up <eol> some of # xxx old as well. <eob>
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx <eob> # have # with companies <eol> xxxx xxx # xxxxx <eob> to # xxxxxx ways of # working. <eob>
xxxxxxxx # every company <eol> has their <eob> xxx skeptics <eob> about why # this # is not <eol> going # xx work # for # <eob>
xxxx # product is # more complex," <eob> or "They don't xxxx <eol> the legacy # IT like do," <eob> "Regulators # just won't allow this <eob> xx # our industry". <eob>
But for this # also <eob> xxx # companies <eob> that x xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> was possible. <eob>
x # we completely <eol> xxxx # up old silos <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx channels # and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
So instead of product xxxxxx <eol> sitting xxxx xxxx product people <eob> and engineers # with engineers, <eob> a product person # xx engineer <eol> were members <eob> of # same xxxxx <eob>
xxx xxxxx # xx # <eob> member of # a team <eol> responsible account # opening <eob> or for the # mobile banking xxxx etc. <eob>
At xxxxxxx date <eol> that # new xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # people were shaking # xxxxx <eol> for # xxx very first only # # find # out that they had been <eob> sitting two minutes away # xxxx # each # <eob> but they were sending each # other emails <eol> xxx status # xxx the # last # 10 # years. <eob>
# would xxxx someone saying, # xx you're the guy that was <eol> for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
now, # <eob> they're # xxxxxx <eol> together # every
If the product # # an # xxxxx <eol> he # xxxx xxxxx it <eob> to # get input from # the engineer <eol> who # xxxxxxx xxxx <eob>
can decide to # test with xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> no # xx PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just # getting xxxxx done. <eob>
# getting <eob> # is xxx easy. <eob>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What # <eol> you # willing # to # xxxx # up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous # <eol> requires <eob> # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions going <eol> up and down the <eob> organization, <eob> we want # xxxx <eob> # # decide. <eob>
But # to xx so, xxxx all the skills <eol> xxx expertise # for that decision <eob> in <eob>
# this brings trade-offs. <eob>
# we physically xxx xxxxxx <eol> who are in different buildings, <eob> xxxxxxxxx cities xx even <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eob>
Or # xx <eol> in <eob> # better videoconferencing? <eob>
xxx do we # xxxxxx <eol> in # the way we do xxxxxx <eol> these teams? <eob>
We xxxxx <eol> xxxx # <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx <eol> matrix. <eob>
# xxx # these xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and process # and xx they # not xxxxx <eob>
But the xxxx <eob> I xxxxx # that # # most <eol> difficult # xx <eol> # change is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx me try <eob>
xxxx # these teams <eol> # be fast, <eol> flexible, # # x # they xxxx to # be empowered <eob> xxx autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx leaders <eol> commanding # their # people what to # xxx <eob> when to do, how # xx <eob>
No # micromanagers. <eob>
But it means that each employee <eob> xxxxx # xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # formal xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx # xx <eol> xx xxxx initiative. <eob>
# xxxxxxxxxx xx # xxxx cannot afford <eob> xxxx all # these teams <eol> in xxxxxxxxx directions, <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx would <eol> certainly # lead to chaos.
we # and xxxxxxxx <eol> at # same xxxxx <eob> just # xxxx flock # of birds. <eob>
an organizational # setting, requires new behaviors, <eol> xxx with xxxx behavior, <eob> there is up on # old well. <eob>
Leaders # xxxx to make sure <eol> xxxx everyone in the organization is xxxxxxx # around <eol> the purpose xx the # why -- <eob> the overall # priorities -- xxx <eol> # xxxxx
then # <eol> have to let # go <eob> and # <eob> xxxx the right decisions <eol> # how # <eol> to get <eob> there.
Now, creating xxxxxxxxx requires <eol> open # xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication. <eob>
But you know # how they # xxx <eol> that # information # source # of power? <eob>
xxxxx for some # managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if <eol> # giving # up that xxxxxx of # power. <eol>
And it's just # xxxxxxxxx <eob>
teams <eol> xxxxxx and # xx # well. <eob>
xx xxx # teams typically # xxxx xxxxx <eob> and xx <eob> # end of # every sprint, <eol> they organize # a xxxx # <eob> to share the <eol> of <eob> what done, # transparently. <eob>
And # day, <eol> each # member of # # xxxx gives an of they are xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable # for # people, <eob> because # suddenly, there <eol> xx xxxxx to hide # anymore. <eob>
Everything we <eol> xxx everyone. <eob>
So, is <eol> xxx # <eol> and # <eol> is not # # either. <eol>
One # executive # <eob> likes # xx how xx xxxx to be <eol> a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now, today, to # xxxx <eob> how # are # going, <eob> instead # of xxxxxxx at status # reports, <eol> he # needs to walk # <eob> # # # xxxx floors one of # their sessions. <eob>
instead of # people xxxx to do, <eob> he looks # ways to # help # them. <eob>
xxxx is change <eol> for # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eol> # xxxxxx of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # the old world, xxxx executive xxxxx "I only the xxxxxxxx control. <eob>
In reality, projects would # run <eol> over time over anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> earlier xxxxxxxx <eob>
And middle xxxxxxxx <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without <eol> the PowerPoint, <eob> there's # less # <eob> of # a need <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And # in xxx # there was <eol> # idea of and doers. <eob>
# would # xxxx follow orders. <eol>
But # # instead of xxxx <eol> other <eob> middle managers # expected <eol> to become # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # <eob> xxx the last xx <eob> you xxxx been # telling <eol> other xxxxxx # what xx <eob> but xxxxxx expected # xx things yourself <eob>
xxxxxxxx # this model # is xxx xxx everyone, <eob> xxx # xxxx great # people leave # the <eob>
xxx xxx result # a # culture <eob> xxxx less # <eob>
xxx of xxxx # xxxx <eob> work. <eob>
But # it.
The companies that # x worked with, <eol> they # were used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx features # few # times <eob> # year. <eob>
Now xxxx # every few weeks, <eob> and # xxx handovers <eol> # # red tape, # whole # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> more xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # finally, xxxx # <eol> these # companies xxxxxx <eob> just a # new
feels as # if you're walking <eol> the halls of xxxxx <eob>
Now, to xxxxx these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But # at xxxxx this # xxx model, <eob> # are much better prepared to respond # <eob>
The world getting # faster <eol> xxx # more xxxxxxxx <eob> so we to reboot our # of # working.
And xxx hardest # xxxx of that # xxxxxx <eol> is # in # structure <eob> or process # or <eob> procedure, and it's also # not just <eol> xxxxxx executives taking charge. <eob>
