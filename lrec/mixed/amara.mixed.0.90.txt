Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers -- <eob> questioning your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, waking up to an angry message, <eob> scared and worried for your safety. <eol>
Welcome to the <eob> world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of harassment that women <eob> face in <eol> Pakistan is very serious <eol> and leads to <eob> sometimes deadly outcomes. <eol>
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression.
Pakistan is the <eob> sixth most populous <eol> country in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access <eob> to <eob> mobile technologies, and 15 percent internet penetration.
And this number doesn't seem to go down with the rise of new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace <eob> Prize winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eol>
But that's just one <eob> aspect <eol> of <eob> Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor is <eob> linked to <eol> women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called "family honor"; <eol> where women are left to die <eob> right outside <eob> their <eol> houses <eob> for speaking to a man on a mobile <eob> phone, <eob> in the name of "family <eob> honor". <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eob>
I come from a very small village <eob> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education. <eol>
The elders of my extended family <eob> didn't <eob> allow their women <eol> to pursue their higher education <eol> or their professional careers.
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family, <eol> my father was one who really <eol> supported my <eob> ambitions.
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, it was really difficult, and <eol> [there were] frowns of disapproval.
But in the end, I knew <eob> it's either me or them, <eob> and <eol> I chose myself. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
My <eob> family's traditions and expectations for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eol> phone until I was married. <eob>
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool <eob> for my <eol> own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eol> he really didn't approve of <eol> this <eob> and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
And that was the time when I first asked myself, "Why? <eol>
Why are women <eol> not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eol> enshrined in our Constitution? <eob>
While the law states that a woman <eob> has <eob> the same equal access <eob> to <eob> the information, why is it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eol> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So <eol> I decided <eob> to take a step, <eol> instead <eob> of <eob> keep questioning <eol> these patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I founded the Digital Rights <eob> Foundation in <eob> 2012 to address all the <eol> issues <eob> and <eob> women's experiences in online spaces and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women that access to the safe internet <eob> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eol> to address the questions <eol> that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With a hope in my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, <eol> I started Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line <eol> in December 2016 -- <eob> (Applause) <eol>
to extend my support to the <eol> women <eob> who do not know who to turn to <eol> when they face serious threats online. <eol>
I think of the women who do not have <eol> the necessary support <eol> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe in <eob> online spaces, <eol> and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is <eol> a rape <eob> threat in their <eol> in-box. <eol>
Safe access to the internet <eol> is an access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom.
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eol> some of our great institutions <eol> are failing us. <eob>
Why? <eol>
In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, <eol> but often, they've taken <eob> us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eol>
And this is unacceptable.
This has to <eob> stop. <eol>
How are <eol> we going to <eob> correct these wrongs?
How are we going <eol> to choose the right course?
It's not going to be <eob> easy.
For years, I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen the right objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eol>
Many have <eob> succeeded, others of them have failed. <eob>
And today I'm going to share <eob> with you <eol> what really makes a difference <eol> -- <eob> that's what's crucial, <eob> how and why <eol> they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons. <eol>
Let's go back to 1975.
Yep, this is me. <eob>
I've got a lot to learn, <eol> I'm a computer <eob> engineer, <eol> I've got long hair, but I'm <eob> working under Andy Grove, <eol> who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what you know. <eol>
Execution is what matters the most".
And <eob> so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and Key Results".
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
And it's all <eob> about excellent execution. <eol>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove.
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management by objective systems <eob> are <eob> the objectives and the key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the <eob> direction. <eol>
The key results have to be measured, <eol> but <eol> at the end you can <eob> look <eol> and without any argument say, "Did <eob> I do that, or <eob> did I not do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
John Doerr: That's Andy.
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eol> are a simple goal-setting system and <eol> they work for organizations, they work <eol> for teams, they even work for individuals.
The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. <eol>
The key results are how <eob> I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's the truth: <eol> many of <eob> us are setting goals wrong, <eol> and most of us are not setting goals at all. <eol>
A lot of organizations <eob> set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, <eol> they make their numbers, <eol> but <eob> they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams.
So <eob> how do you set <eol> these goals the right way? <eol>
First, you must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" <eol> Why?
Because truly transformational teams <eob> combine <eob> their ambitions <eol> to their passion and to their <eol> purpose, and they develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of why. <eob>
I want to tell you a story. <eol>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna.
Nuna is a health <eob> care data company. <eol>
And when Nuna was founded, <eol> they used data to serve the health <eol> needs <eol> of lots of workers at <eol> large companies. <eob>
And <eob> then two years <eob> into the <eol> company's life, <eol> the federal government issued <eob> a proposal to build <eob> the first ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eol>
Now, <eob> you'll remember <eol> that <eob> Medicaid is that program that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eol> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the <eob> time was just 15 people <eol> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, and <eob> they had a whole set of commitments <eob> that they had to honor, <eol> and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money on the project.
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it.
She jumped at the opportunity. She did not flinch.
Why?
Well, it's a personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism. <eol>
And when <eob> he was seven, <eol> he had his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eol>
He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing.
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. <eob>
They came to the country with limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eol> so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in <eol> Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine years old. <eob>
That moment defined <eob> her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won <eol> and <eob> delivered <eob> on that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy, and today <eol> it provides for Kimong's health <eol> and for <eob> millions of others. <eol>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Every row of data is <eob> a life <eol> whose story deserves <eob> to <eol> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: <eob> And Jini's story tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why <eol> can be the <eob> launchpad <eob> for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to <eol> have accomplished.
And objectives are significant, <eol> they're <eol> action-oriented, <eol> they are inspiring, and they're a <eob> kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eob> would be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key Results, <eol> but for years, Bono has <eob> used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty and <eob> disease, and his ONE organization <eol> has focused on two <eob> really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives.
The first is debt relief for the <eol> poorest countries in the world. <eol>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go <eob> back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? <eol> Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eol>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eol>
How passionate? <eol>
What actions does your <eol> passion <eol> lead you to do?
If the heart doesn't find <eob> a perfect rhyme with the <eol> head, then <eob> your passion means nothing. <eol>
The OKR framework <eob> cultivates the madness, the <eol> chemistry contained inside <eol> it. <eob>
It gives us an environment for risk, for <eob> trust, where failing is not a fireable offense. <eol>
And when you have <eob> that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right people, magic is around the corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eol> and magic is right around the corner. <eol>
This is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eol> with Bono the whats of goal-setting.
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eol>
Remember, the <eob> hows are the key results. That's how we meet <eol> our objectives.
And good results are specific and time-bound. <eol>
They're aggressive but realistic. <eol>
They're measurable, <eob> and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In <eob> 1999, I introduced OKRs <eob> to Google's cofounders, <eol> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they are, 24 years old in their garage.
And Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eol>
Well, not quite.
What he really said was, <eob> "We don't have any <eol> other way <eob> to manage this company, so we'll give it a go". (Laughter)
And I took that as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler <eob> has written down her objectives and her key results. <eol>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've <eob> published them <eob> for everyone to see. <eol>
And these are not used <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eol>
They're set aside. <eol>
They're used for a higher purpose, <eob> and <eob> that's to get collective <eob> commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar <eob> Pichai, took on <eol> an objective <eob> which was to build <eob> the next generation client platform for the future of web applications -- in other words, build the best browser. <eob>
He was <eob> very thoughtful about how he chose his key results.
How do you measure the best <eob> browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, because users are going <eob> to decide if Chrome is a great <eol> browser or not. <eob>
So he had this one <eob> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck <eol> to the same key results, numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In <eol> the first year, <eol> his goal was 20 million users <eol> and he <eob> missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he <eob> raised the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users.
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third year, <eob> he upped the ante once more <eol> to a hundred million.
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 million users. <eol>
Here's why <eol> I like this story, <eol> not so much for <eob> the happy <eob> ending, <eol> but it shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eol> and then sticking to it year after year after year. <eol>
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me. <eob>
Now, I think of OKRs <eol> as transparent vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really <eob> matters is the why <eol> that we pour into those vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are <eob> not a silver bullet.
They're not going <eob> to be a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, <eob> but when those <eob> fundamentals are in place, they can take you to the mountaintop. <eol>
I want you to think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eol>
Do you <eob> have the right metrics?
Take time to write down your values, <eob> your objectives and <eol> your key results. <eol>
Do <eob> it today. <eol>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eob> you can send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of <eob> a Nuna, of Bono, of Google, they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, <eol> high-quality <eob> for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eol> access to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is that really matters, <eol> because we can take OKRs <eol> beyond <eob> our <eob> businesses. <eob>
We can take them to our families, <eol> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments. <eol>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eol>
We <eob> can transform those <eob> informations.
We can get back on the right track <eol> if we can and do measure <eob> what really matters. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
What is history? <eol>
It is something written by the winners.
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be <eol> focused on the rulers, like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or determined by the leaders, <eol> and <eob> common people could not influence it in any way.
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been <eob> or <eob> ever will be a truly democratic nation, and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed to the citizens of Russia. <eol>
And this is not true. <eol>
To prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year of the <eob> Russian Revolution. <eob>
I asked myself, what if the <eob> internet and <eol> Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we <eol> built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eol> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created our software, digitized <eob> and uploaded <eob> all possible real diaries and letters written by more than 3,000 people <eob> 100 years ago.
So any user of <eol> our website or application can follow a news feed <eob> for each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eob> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eol> Lenin or Pavlova <eob> and others thought and felt.
We <eob> watch all those personalities <eob> being ordinary people like you and me, <eol> not demigods, <eol> and we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eol> not only their "genius ideas".
Our project was a shock for many Russians, <eol> who used to think that our country <eol> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom <eob> and democracy could never have prevailed, just because <eob> democracy <eol> was not our destiny.
But if we take a broader look, <eol> it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 led to 70 <eob> years of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this <eol> project, we <eol> see <eol> that <eob> Russia <eol> could have had a different history <eob> and a democratic future, as any other country could <eob> or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia was the first <eol> country in the world <eob> to abolish the death penalty, <eol> or one of the first ones to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced history <eol> can help us create a <eob> better future, because history is just <eol> a rehearsal <eol> of <eol> what's happening right now. <eob>
We do need new ways <eob> of telling history, and this year, for example, we <eol> started a new online project <eob> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary series <eol> that gives you <eol> an impression of that year, 1968, a year marked by global social change <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now.
But we <eob> are making <eob> that history alive <eob> by imagining what if all the <eob> main characters could use mobile phones ... <eol> just like that? <eob>
And we see that a lot of individuals <eol> were facing the same challenges <eol> and were fighting <eol> for the same values, <eol> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eol> or in <eob> France or in China or in Czechoslovakia.
By exposing history in such a democratic way, <eol> through social media, <eob> we show that people in power <eob> are not the only ones making choices.
That gives any user a possibility <eob> of reclaiming history. <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eol>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers matter. <eol>
We <eol> shape society.
We all make history. <eol>
Thank you.
(Applause)
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks with <eol> high accuracies, at a massive scale, <eol> using human-like intelligence. <eob>
And this intelligence of computers <eol> is often referred to as AI <eol> or artificial intelligence.
AI <eob> is poised to make an incredible impact <eob> on our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eob> we <eob> still <eob> face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eob> several life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases and cancer.
Thousands of patients every year lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer.
Our best <eol> way to help these patients is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases.
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eob> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, are suspected of these diseases, <eol> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive medical imaging technologies <eol> such as fluorescent <eol> imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eol>
Once those images are collected, another expert physician then diagnoses those images and talks to the <eob> patient.
As you can see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eol> requiring both expert physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, and is <eob> not <eob> considered <eol> practical for the developing world. <eob>
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized nations, as well.
So, can we solve this problem <eol> using artificial intelligence?
Today, if I were to use traditional <eob> artificial intelligence architectures <eol> to <eob> solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eob> of <eob> these very expensive medical images <eob> first to be generated. <eol>
After that, <eol> I would then go <eol> to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eob> those images for me. <eol>
And using those two pieces of information, I can train a standard deep neural network <eob> or a deep learning network <eob> to <eol> provide patient's diagnosis. <eol>
Similar to <eol> the first approach, <eol> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the same problem. <eol>
Large amounts of data, expert physicians <eol> and expert medical imaging technologies.
So, can we invent more scalable, effective <eob> and more valuable artificial <eob> intelligence architectures to solve these very important <eob> problems facing us today? <eol>
And this is exactly what my group at MIT Media Lab does. <eol>
We have invented a <eob> variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures <eob> to solve <eob> some of the most important <eol> challenges facing us today <eol> in medical imaging and clinical trials.
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eol>
Our first goal was to reduce <eob> the number of images <eob> required to train <eob> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eol> we wanted to reduce the use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eol> to screen patients. <eol>
So how did we do it? <eob>
For our first goal, instead of starting <eol> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eob>
From this image, my team <eol> and I <eol> figured out a very clever way <eol> to extract billions <eob> of information packets. <eol>
These <eob> information packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and rendering of the <eol> disease on the medical image.
In a sense, we converted one image into billions of training data points, <eol> massively reducing the amount of data needed for training. <eob>
For our <eob> second goal, <eol> to <eol> reduce the use of expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started <eob> with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR <eol> camera <eob> or a mobile phone, for the patient. <eol>
Then remember those billions of <eol> information packets? <eob>
We overlaid those from the medical image onto this image, <eob> creating <eob> something <eob> that we call a <eob> composite image. <eol>
Much to our surprise, we only required 50 -- <eol> I repeat, only 50 -- <eol> of these composite <eob> images to train <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eol>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eob> we can now train the AI algorithms <eob> in <eob> an unorthodox way, <eob> using only 50 of these high-resolution, <eob> but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> and mobile phones, and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eol> our algorithms can accept, <eob> in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, white light <eob> photographs from the patient, instead of expensive <eol> medical <eol> imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that we are poised to <eol> enter an era <eob> where artificial intelligence is going to make <eob> an incredible <eol> impact <eol> on our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking <eob> about traditional AI, which is data-rich but application-poor, we <eol> should also continue thinking about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eol> which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much.
(Applause) <eol>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, <eol> just like <eob> getting over a cold, you could heal your wounds faster?
Today, if we have an operation or an accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for weeks, and often left with scars <eol> and painful side effects of our inability <eob> to regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune system to give us <eol> the signals to <eob> grow new tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eob> our body to fight disease, we could instead instruct <eob> our immune system to build tissues and more quickly heal wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eol> that can achieve this feat.
Some lizards can regrow their tails, the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, and even us mere humans can regrow our <eol> liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eol>
To make this magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body <eob> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions <eob> from the immune system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that <eob> annoying sinus <eol> infection, our immune <eob> system defends <eol> our body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> and by <eob> using what I know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eob> our cuts and <eol> bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being tested <eol> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that <eob> after treating <eol> an injured muscle with these materials, there was a large number of immune cells <eob> in that material and the surrounding muscle.
So in this case, <eol> instead of the <eob> immune cells rushing off <eob> towards infection to <eob> fight bacteria, they're rushing toward an <eob> injury.
I discovered a specific <eol> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T cell, was present inside <eol> that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound healing. <eol>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eob> and you'd break <eob> your pencil <eol> and try <eob> and tape it back together again, we can heal, <eol> but it might not be <eol> in the most functional way, <eol> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So <eol> if we don't have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops fat cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our muscle, <eob> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, our body <eob> could grow back <eol> without these scars and look like what it was <eob> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working to create materials that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that any time a material is implanted in our body, the immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from <eob> pacemakers to <eob> insulin pumps <eol> to <eol> the materials that engineers are using to try and build new <eob> tissue. <eol>
So when I <eol> place that material, <eol> or <eob> scaffold, in the body, the immune <eob> system creates a small environment of cells and proteins that can change the way that our stem cells behave.
Now, just like the weather <eob> affects our daily activities, like going for a run or staying <eob> inside and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we get fat cells instead of <eob> muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eob> of a <eob> variety of different things, from plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less porous, <eol> gels of different stiffnesses.
And researchers can even make the materials <eob> release different signals over <eob> time. <eol>
So in <eol> other words, we <eol> can orchestrate this Broadway show of cells <eob> by <eob> giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed <eol> for different tissues, <eol> just <eob> like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of signals <eol> that mimic how our body responds to <eol> injury <eob> to help us <eol> regenerate.
In the <eob> future, we <eol> could see a scar-proof <eob> band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we aren't going to wake up <eob> tomorrow <eol> and be <eol> able to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with these advances, and working <eob> with our immune system <eob> to help build tissue <eob> and heal wounds, we could begin seeing products on the market that work with our <eob> body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eol> and maybe one day be able <eob> to keep <eob> pace <eol> with a salamander. <eol>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time <eol> at my great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, <eol> humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eol> and <eob> stick <eob> my face in front <eob> of her only air conditioner. <eol>
But I didn't realize that that <eob> simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community.
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors having to set up fake energy accounts or having to steal energy <eol> seemed normal to <eob> me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, <eob> my neighbors would have no <eob> choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eol> after <eob> their heat was shut off, just to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one <eob> more day. <eob>
These kinds of dangerous incidents can take root <eob> when people are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eol>
In the US, the average American spends <eob> three percent of their income <eob> on energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income and rural populations can spend 20, even 30 percent of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eol> 25 million <eob> people to skip meals to provide power to their homes. <eol>
This is when energy becomes a burden.
But energy burdens are so much more than just a number.
They present impossible and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to get her flu medicine, or do you feed her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm?
It's <eob> an impossible choice, <eob> and nearly every month, <eob> seven million <eol> people choose between medicine and energy. <eol>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and systemic issue. <eol>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, <eol> who spend more per square foot <eob> than their white counterparts.
But it's also nurses, veterans and <eob> even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 million people <eol> a year who are unable to <eol> afford energy <eob> for their most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those with high energy burdens <eob> have a <eol> greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma.
Look -- given <eob> our rockets to Mars <eob> and our pocket-sized AI, we have the tools to address <eol> these systemic inequities. <eol>
The technology is here.
Cost of renewables, insulation, microgrids and smart home technology <eol> are all decreasing.
However, even as <eob> we approach cost parity, <eob> the <eol> majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American. <eob>
This is why, when I was 22, I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eol>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by working with communities, <eob> utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology.
But there's no one way to solve this.
I believe <eob> in the power <eol> of local communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships. <eol>
So we start by working directly <eol> with the <eol> communities <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eol>
We host workshops and events for <eob> communities <eob> to learn about energy poverty, <eol> and <eob> how making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eol> like better insulation for windows and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency.
We're connecting <eob> neighborhoods <eob> to community solar and spearheading <eob> community-led <eob> smart home research <eob> and installation programs to <eob> help families bring down <eob> their energy bills. <eol>
We're even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eob> of energy equity and resilience succeed, we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US spends <eob> over <eol> three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
And these programs do help <eob> millions of people, but they're only able to help a fraction of those in need. <eob>
In fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar home-energy affordability gap, <eol> so assistance alone is not sustainable. <eol>
But by building energy equity <eob> and resilience into our communities, we can assure fair and impartial access <eol> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable.
At scale, microgrid technology, clean technology and energy efficiency <eob> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eol> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income who's struggling <eob> to make ends meet. <eol>
This is life-changing. <eol>
This <eob> is an <eob> opportunity <eob> for families to use their energy savings to sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eol> and her neighbors, the impossible <eob> choices <eol> that they had to make <eol> and the effect it had on our whole community.
But this is not just about them. <eol>
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible choices today. <eob>
And <eol> I know high energy burdens <eol> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, but through relationships <eob> with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eob>
And <eol> when we do, <eol> we will all be more resilient. <eol>
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever watched a flock of birds work together?
Thousands of animals, <eob> flying in <eob> perfect synchrony: Isn't it fascinating? <eob>
What I find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that if they all would have <eob> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction speed <eol> would <eob> simply be too low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are <eol> aligned on <eob> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eob> to make <eob> autonomous decisions while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eol> and their autonomy <eob> makes them <eol> fast <eol> and <eob> flexible. <eob>
Now, what does this have to do <eob> with any one of us?
Well, it's one way of illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of working today. <eol>
The world is <eol> getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eol> so we need a new way of working, <eob> a way that creates alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes out bureaucracy and that truly empowers people to make decisions faster.
But the question is: In order to get there, what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was working with a bank <eol> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be simpler, more intuitive, more relevant. <eol>
Now, I'm not sure how many <eol> of you have seen a bank <eol> from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate what many traditional banks look like.
You see <eob> lots of people in suits <eob> taking elevators to go to <eob> their department, <eol> marketers sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers with engineers, etc. <eol>
You see meetings with 20 people where nothing gets decided.
Great ideas? They end up <eob> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eob> between departments.
Getting anything done can take forever.
So this bank knew <eob> that in order to transform, they would have to improve their <eob> time to market <eol> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well.
But how?
To <eob> get some inspiration, we decided <eob> to go and have a look at companies <eol> that seem to be more innovative, like <eob> Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how we <eob> were walking <eob> the halls at one of these companies <eob> in December 2014, a management consultant and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt like strangers <eob> in a strange land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies and lots of smart, creative employees. <eol>
So <eob> then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eol> And we expected to get an org chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings with funny names like "squads" <eob> and "chapters" and "tribes" to explain how they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to translate that to our own <eol> world. <eob>
We asked, "How many people are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who decides on your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
You can imagine our surprise.
We <eol> were asking for what we thought <eol> were some of the basic principles of organizations, and their answer was, "It depends". <eol>
Now, over the course of that day, <eob> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model.
They believed in the power of small, <eol> autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team <eob> so they could design, build <eob> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of others in the company. <eol>
They did <eob> not need handovers between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eob> right there in the <eob> team.
Now, at the end of that day, we had a session <eob> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started to like their model, <eob> so we were already thinking of how <eob> to apply some of these ideas to a bank.
But then, <eob> one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said <eob> a word all <eob> day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see you like our model. <eob>
But I have one question for <eob> you: <eol> What are you willing to <eol> give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eob> but we knew <eob> he was right. <eol>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eob> on some <eob> of the old as well.
Now, over the past five years, <eol> I have <eob> worked with companies all over the world to change their ways of working.
And clearly, every company <eol> has their own skeptics about why this is not <eol> going to <eob> work for them. <eob>
"Our product is <eob> more <eob> complex," or "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like we do," or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry". <eol>
But for this bank and also <eol> for the <eol> other companies <eol> that I have worked with afterwards, <eol> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we <eob> completely <eob> blew up the old silos <eob> between marketing, product, channels and IT.
Three thousand employees were reorganized into 350 multidisciplinary teams.
So <eob> instead of product people sitting just with product people <eob> and <eob> engineers with engineers, <eob> a product <eob> person and an engineer were now <eob> members <eob> of the same team. <eol>
You could be a member of a team <eob> responsible for account opening <eol> or for the mobile <eob> banking app, etc.
At the go-live date of that new organization, <eol> some people were shaking hands <eob> for the very first time, <eob> only to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they were sending each other <eol> emails <eol> and status reports for the last 10 years. <eob>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that <eob> I <eob> was always <eol> chasing for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're <eol> having <eob> coffee <eob> together every <eol> day. <eol>
If the product guy has an idea, <eob> he can just raise <eob> it <eob> to get <eob> input from the engineer <eob> who <eob> is sitting <eol> right next to <eob> him.
They <eol> can <eol> decide to <eob> test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eol> just getting stuff <eob> done. <eob>
Now, getting there is not easy.
And <eob> as it turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" is exactly the right question to <eol> ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of <eob> decisions going <eob> up and down the organization, we want the team to decide. <eol>
But to do <eob> so, we need all the skills and expertise for that decision in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we <eob> physically co-locate our people <eol> who are working in different buildings, <eol> different cities <eol> or even <eol> different countries today? <eob>
Or <eob> should we invest in <eob> better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure <eob> consistency <eol> in the <eob> way <eob> we do things <eol> across these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eol> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all these changes to structure and process and procedure -- <eob> they are not easy.
But in the end, <eol> I found that the most <eob> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eol>
Let <eol> me try to illustrate. <eol>
If we <eol> want these teams to <eol> be fast, flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up, they <eol> have to be empowered and autonomous.
But this means we <eob> cannot <eob> have leaders <eob> commanding their people what to do, <eol> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers.
But it also means that each employee needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of their formal title. <eob>
It's about all <eob> of <eob> us stepping up to take initiative. <eol>
Now obviously, we also cannot afford <eob> to have all these teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because that would <eob> certainly lead to chaos. <eol>
So we need alignment and autonomy <eob> at the same time, <eol> just like a flock of birds.
In an organizational setting, this requires new behaviors, <eol> and with <eol> each new behavior, <eob> there is giving up on something old <eob> as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure that everyone in the organization is aligned <eol> around the overall purpose -- the why <eob> -- and <eob> the overall priorities <eob> -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go and trust their teams to make the right decisions <eob> on how to get <eob> there.
Now, creating alignment requires open and transparent communication. <eob>
But you know how they <eol> say <eob> that information is a source of power? <eol>
Well, for some managers, sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eol>
And it's not just managers.
The <eob> teams need to communicate openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams typically work in short sprints, <eob> and <eob> at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo <eob> session <eol> to share the output <eob> of what they've done, transparently.
And every day, <eob> each member of the team gives an update of what they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable for people, <eol> because <eol> suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore.
Everything we do <eob> is transparent for everyone.
So, alignment is not easy, <eob> and providing autonomy <eob> is not so <eob> obvious, <eol> either. <eob>
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain how he used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how things are going, instead of looking at status reports, <eob> he needs to walk down to the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions.
And instead of telling people what to do, he looks for ways to <eol> help them. <eob>
That <eol> is radical change <eob> for someone who <eob> used to be <eob> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But <eol> in the old world, this executive said, "I only had the illusion <eob> of control. <eob>
In reality, many projects would run <eob> over time <eob> and over <eob> budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, <eol> and I <eob> can course-correct much earlier if needed". <eob>
And middle managers need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eol> there's less of <eol> a need <eob> for middle managers.
And in the <eob> old world, <eob> there was <eol> this idea <eob> of thinkers and doers.
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only managing other people, middle managers were expected <eob> to become player-coaches. <eol>
So imagine, for the last <eol> 10 years, <eob> you <eob> have just been telling <eol> other people what to do, <eol> but now you're expected <eol> to do things <eol> yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this <eob> model is <eob> not for <eol> everyone, <eob> and some great people leave the company. <eol>
But the result is a new culture <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And <eob> all of this is hard work.
But it's worth it. <eol>
The companies that I worked with, <eol> they were used to deploying new product features a few <eol> times per year. <eol>
Now they <eob> have releases <eob> every few weeks, <eob> and without the handovers <eob> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eob> becomes more efficient.
And finally, if you walk <eob> the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eol>
It feels as if you're walking the halls of a very large start-up. <eob>
Now, to <eob> be fair, these companies, they cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, they <eol> are much better prepared to respond to change. <eol>
The world is getting faster and more complex, so we need to reboot our way of working.
And the hardest part of that <eob> change is not in structure or process or procedure, and it's also not just <eol> senior executives taking charge.
Leaders will <eob> be all of those <eol> in the organization <eol> who embrace <eob> the change.
We all have to lead the change. <eol>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you.
(Applause)
A leader is steady, firm, <eol> decisive, unwavering. <eol>
Never let 'em see you sweat, <eob> always <eob> have <eol> an answer. <eol>
[The Way We <eol> Work] <eol> My name is Dan, I'm a partner <eol> at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's <eol> another side to me: Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I created on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought about my <eob> double life, <eol> I couldn't help but wonder <eob> ... <eob>
When your true self <eob> is a little nontraditional, <eol> how much of it can you really bring to the office? <eol>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits?
For the <eol> first 10 years of my career, <eol> I thought there was one way to be a leader: decisive and serious. <eob>
But that's not me. <eol>
So I'd put on basically <eob> office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in <eob> my hand motions. <eob>
I'm someone who gets really excited about things, so I'd temper that.
I had this little voice <eob> in <eob> my head, telling me, "You're too <eol> gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had one well-intentioned <eol> adviser who said, <eol> "Everyone <eol> knows you're gay. <eob> And that's great. <eob>
But you don't need to beat them over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: <eob> me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eol>
I dressed up as <eol> my favorite TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, thinking my friends <eol> would get a kick out of it.
And then, things <eob> got crazy.
The <eob> post went viral, <eol> and at first it was pure fun. <eol>
I started getting these incredible messages <eob> from people <eob> about how happy it made them, how it <eob> encouraged them <eob> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time <eol> to tell that <eol> little voice in my head <eol> to just shut up <eob> and let myself be me.
But then things got a little too big. <eob>
Carrie Dragshaw <eob> was everywhere -- <eob> In the "New <eob> York <eob> Post", <eol> "US Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eol> "What would my bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eob> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" I thought I was going to have to <eol> get <eol> a different job. <eob>
But then, something happened, something small. <eob>
I got a text from my boss, <eob> it wasn't long, it just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With <eob> a link to an article <eol> that had just gone up about me. <eol>
And it <eob> let me <eob> put that little, scared voice <eob> away <eob> and just be <eol> excited <eol> about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked out.
That's the power of one person, <eob> sometimes all it takes is one ally <eob> to make you feel comfortable.
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently. <eol>
They became more open, <eol> more playful with me, <eol> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eob> gave them permission to be more of themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness <eob> and vulnerability would actually <eob> decrease my standing with my team. <eob>
But it's done the opposite. <eol>
Two years in, <eob> I never could have imagined that this part of me would not just be embraced, <eob> but could actually <eol> help my career. <eob>
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New <eob> York City, <eol> in an office where creativity is valued <eob> and I was already pretty established <eob> in my career when all <eob> of this started.
Maybe that's you, maybe <eol> it isn't. <eol>
But all <eob> of this has taught me so much <eob> about just the importance <eol> of bringing your whole self to work.
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions <eol> about what it takes <eob> to be successful.
There's no one kind of way to be a leader. <eol>
It's about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them. <eol>
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eol> I'd put on my perfect leader <eob> mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, <eob> "Gosh, that was frustrating". <eob>
We can talk <eol> about challenges <eob> and struggles in an open way, <eob> rather than everybody pretending that they're fine until <eob> it's too late.
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eob> spent pretending, <eob> wishing you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to me, though, <eol> is that in <eol> this big study of covering, 93 <eob> percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it also believe their organization <eob> values inclusion. <eol>
So clearly, our <eob> workplaces <eol> and all of our <eol> strange inner voices <eol> have a long way to go on acceptance. <eob>
There's a big difference <eob> between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a <eob> little late.
Personally, I'm taking all of this <eol> as a call to be the ally who, like my boss did for me, <eol> lets people know that it's OK to open up. <eob>
If you're <eob> gay, or proud <eol> of your <eob> ethnic background, <eol> or have <eol> a disability <eol> or are deeply religious, <eol> see what it's like being your full self at work. <eob>
You might be <eol> pleasantly surprised.
The basic problem <eob> with working in an office is you're just <eob> not <eol> in control of your work <eob> environment. <eob>
[The Way We Work] <eol> Howdy, <eol> my name is Matt, <eob> and I'm the CEO of Automattic, <eob> the company behind WordPress.com, <eob> Jetpack and WooCommerce. <eob>
We're coming up on over 800 employees, <eob> and they live everywhere, <eol> from California to Alabama, Mississippi, <eol> to where I live in Texas. <eob>
They're also in 67 countries.
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand.
Some of them choose not even <eol> to have a home base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether <eob> they are in RVs <eob> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eol> they are in new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care <eol> where they are.
Our focus on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eol>
It was a conscious choice from the very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't use the word <eob> "remote," <eol> because it sets up the expectation, that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eol>
I use the word "distributed" <eob> to describe what we do, <eol> where everyone is <eob> on an equal playing <eol> field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective way <eob> to build a company. <eob>
The key is you have to approach it consciously. <eob>
When <eob> we started WordPress, <eol> many of <eob> the first 20 <eob> hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eol>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes for years. <eol>
I wanted to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eob> the big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eob> the same <eol> small pond or bay. <eol>
A <eob> distributed company <eob> can fish from the entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives in California, you can gain someone who lives, works, <eol> wakes up and goes to sleep <eob> wherever they are in the world. <eob> They bring a <eob> different <eob> understanding of that culture and a <eob> different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eob> over how they do <eob> their <eob> work.
Unless you're in a role <eol> where <eob> specific hours are important, you can make your own schedule.
Everyone can have <eob> a <eol> corner office, <eol> their windows, the food they want to eat, you can choose when there's music <eob> and when there's <eob> silence. <eol>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be.
You can save the time you'd spend commuting <eol> and put <eol> it into <eob> things <eob> that are important to you. <eol>
A distributed workforce <eol> is ideal <eob> for a technology company. <eob>
But people often ask me, <eob> "This works great for y'all, <eob> but what about <eob> everyone else?" If you have an office, <eol> you can do a few things <eob> to <eol> build distributed capability. <eob>
First: document everything. <eol>
In an office, <eol> it's easy <eob> to make decisions in the moment, <eob> in the <eol> kitchen, in the hall. <eol>
But if <eob> people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eob> are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being <eob> made <eol> without understanding the why. <eol>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eob> and <eol> what you were thinking about. <eol>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great to think about as an organization evolves, <eol> people leaving and people joining.
Try to have as much communication <eob> as <eol> possible online. <eol>
When everything's shared and public, <eob> it allows new people to <eob> catch up quickly. <eob>
You also need to find the right tools.
There are so many <eol> apps and services <eob> that help with <eob> day-to-day communication, <eol> video conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that changed how you work <eol> probably aren't objects anymore.
They're things you <eob> access <eol> through your computer. <eol>
So experiment with different <eob> tools that enable <eob> collaboration, see what works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eol>
In a <eol> traditional <eob> office, you're in <eob> the same place <eol> 48 <eob> weeks <eol> out of the year and you might have <eob> three or four <eob> weeks apart. <eol>
We try to flip that: we come together for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a <eob> year we do a grand meet-up <eol> where the entire company <eob> comes together for a <eob> week.
It's half-work, half-play. <eob>
The primary goal is connecting people. <eol> We want to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eol> and they have a deeper connection <eol> with their <eob> colleagues. <eol>
When they work together <eol> the rest of <eol> the year, <eol> they can <eob> bring together that <eob> understanding and empathy.
And the final practice: <eol> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic has a <eol> co-working stipend that they can put <eob> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy coffee, so they don't <eob> get kicked out of <eob> the coffee <eob> shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together <eol> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person <eol> who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eol>
This is money they can invest <eob> in getting the <eol> right chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can <eol> have the most productive environment <eob> for them. <eol>
Today, there are <eob> just a few companies that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade <eol> or two, I predict that 90 percent of companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eol> the course of the world are going to function this way.
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced <eob> by those that are. <eol>
As you think about what <eob> you're going <eol> to build next, <eob> consider <eob> how you can <eob> tap into global talent, <eob> give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should <eob> and still participate fully in <eob> whatever it is that you're creating together. <eol>
