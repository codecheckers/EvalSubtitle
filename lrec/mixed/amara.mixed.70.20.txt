Our xxxxxx # goal -- we more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # xxxxxx # xxx # use <eol> xx expensive # medical # technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eob>
So # xx # do it?
For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx tens # xxx <eob> of these # xxxx expensive images, <eol> like # AI, <eob> we # started # xxxx # a xxxxxx # medical image. <eob>
From # xxxx <eob> image, # my xxx x <eol> xxxxxxx out a very clever <eob> extract <eol> of xxxxxxxxxxx #

In # a # sense, we xxxxxxxxx # xxx image <eol> into # billions # # xxxxxxxx # xxxx # massively # xxxxxxxx the xxxxxx of data <eol> needed # for xxxxxxxxx <eob>
For xxxxxx # goal, <eob> xx reduce # use expensive xxxxxxx <eol> technologies screen # patients, we xxxxxxx # with # a # standard, <eol> white # photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eol> or a # xxxxxx # for the patient. <eol>
Then # xxxxx <eol> billions # of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
overlaid those # from <eol> medical # # this image, <eol> creating # <eol> that we call # x # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> we # only required # xx -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # 50 <eob> of composite # images # xx # xxxxx <eol> our # algorithms to # high efficiencies. <eob>
To # approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eol> expensive <eob> can # train # the AI <eol> an # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxx xxxx # 50 of # these high-resolution, <eol> # standard photographs, <eob> acquired # from DSLR <eol> xxx mobile xxxxxxx <eob> diagnosis. <eob>

xxx # I xxxxx xxxx # thinking <eol> about # traditional # AI, <eob> is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we # should also continue # <eob> about xxxxxxxxxx artificial <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> which can # small # amounts xxxx <eob> solve # important <eol> problems facing us <eol> # <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # in health <eob>

A # years # xxxx I was xxxxxxx with # a # xxxx <eob> that wanted to # <eol> on # xxxxxxx transformation. <eob>

Now, xxx not sure how <eol> of xxx <eol> xxxx # a bank the inside, <eol> so let # me # try illustrate <eol> xxxx # xxxx traditional # banks # look # like. <eob>
You see # of # xxxxxx suits <eol> # # to # go <eol> their <eob> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers # with xxxx <eob>

xxxxxxxx done # xxx take <eob>
this bank <eol> that in xxxxx # transform, <eob> they # would have to improve <eol> xxxx to # market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> xxxx xx xxxxxxx well. <eob>
But <eob>
xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx go and have # a <eob> # at # companies <eob> xxxx # to <eol> be # more innovative, <eol> like Netflix, xxxxxxx <eob>
And remember # were xxxxxxx <eol> the halls # one xx # companies <eob> in xxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> a management # <eol> xxx a xxxx # of <eol> bankers. <eob>
xx felt # like xxxxxxxxx <eob> # xx a strange xxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # hoodies <eob> xxx # lots of xxxxxx creative employees. <eob>
then asked, <eol> "How xx your xxxxxxx <eob> And we expected an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx xxxx used strange # drawings <eob> with funny like # <eol> and # and <eob> xx explain how # they # were <eob>
So xx tried to translate <eol> to xxx own xxxxxx
xx xxxxxx # "How xxxx xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx for # xxxxx <eob> "It depends". <eob>

Now, # xxx xxxxxx that <eob> # gained <eol> # a xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx # of # model. <eob>

xxx xxx need handovers <eol> # departments. <eob>

xxxx xx # the of that <eol> # had # x xxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxxx xx # what we xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>

xxx # xxxxx # one # xx the # <eol> a who had not said a all <eol> xx # xxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> "So I see you # # our model. <eob>
