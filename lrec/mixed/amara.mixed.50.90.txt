xxx then years <eol> into xxx # life, <eob> the issued a proposal to build <eol> the # first # ever cloud database for # Medicaid. <eob>

Nuna at the # time was xxxx people <eob> xxx this database to built in year, <eob> they xxx a whole set of that had to # honor, <eob> and frankly, they # going xx # xxxx <eol> very <eol> much the xxxxxxxx <eol>

Jini's # younger brother Kimong # xxx # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx when # he <eob> seven, <eol> xx had # first grand xxx xxxxxxx Disneyland. <eol>

xxxxxx # parents are Korean

She was nine <eob> xxxxx xxxx
That xxxxxx defined # # xxxxxxxx and that mission became her xxxxxxxx <eol> # that company bid on, # <eob> won and on that #
Here's # <eol> to tell # you why. <eol>
xxxxxxx Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my xxxxxx from today # it provides <eol> for Kimong's health <eob> and # xxx xxxxxxxx # of # <eob>

Every row # of # data is a # life <eol> xxxxx story xxxxxxxx to be # told with dignity. <eob>
# And Jini's <eob> story <eob> tells xx <eob> that a compelling sense why <eol> can be the launchpad # for # objectives. <eob>

And objectives are xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx action-oriented, <eob> xxxx <eob> # are inspiring, <eob> xxx <eob> # they're <eob> # x of vaccine <eob> against <eob> # # thinking. <eob>

What # is history? <eob>

xx # xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx # # diseases, <eol> an xxxxxxxxx first <eol> xxxxxx <eol> very expensive xxxxxxx <eob> # imaging technologies <eob> as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, # xxxxx to be <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>

As you xxx xxxx this is <eob> a very resource-intensive requiring xxxx # expert physicians, <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eol> # xxxxxxx # technologies, and is <eol> xxx considered <eol> practical <eol> for xxx developing <eob>

So, we this <eob> problem <eol> artificial <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxxx xxx traditional artificial intelligence xx # solve <eol> this # problem, <eob> I would require -- <eol> x repeat, on xx order # <eob> of 10,000 of these very <eol> medical <eol> xx # generated. <eol>
After # xxxxx # then go # expert physician, <eob> would xxxx <eob> those images xxx xxx <eob>
And those two pieces of # information, <eol> x # can train xxxx neural network <eob> xx x xxxx learning network to provide xxxxxxxxx diagnosis.
Similar <eob> xx the # first # approach, <eol> traditional xxxxxxxxxx intelligence approaches <eol> xxxxxx from the same xxxxxxxx <eol>

So, <eol> # can we invent xxxx scalable, <eol> effective <eol> and # more # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eol> to solve # these xxxx important problems # facing us xxxxxx <eob>
And <eob> this is xxxxxxx what my # group at MIT Media <eob> Lab does. <eol>
We have invented <eob> # a of AI # architectures to # solve some of the most important <eol> us <eob> today in xxxxxxx # # and clinical <eob> trials. <eob>
In xxxxxxx shared <eol> xxxx # you # had two goals.

# second xxxx xx xx xxxx more xxxxxxxxxx we xxxxxx <eob> of # technologies <eol> xx screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how # xxx we do it?
For our first goal, <eob> instead of xxxxxxxx <eob> with tens xxx thousands xx these # # expensive medical xxxxxxx # traditional AI, <eob> we started # with # single medical image.
xxxx xxxx image, my team and x <eol> figured # a xxxx clever way <eob> xx # extract # billions of information
These # xxxxxxxxxxx packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry <eol> and xxxxxxxxx # xx the # disease on the <eol>
In a sense, # we converted # one <eol> xxxx billions of # training xxxx # points, massively reducing <eob> xxx amount of needed # for training. <eob>
our second <eob> to reduce the xxx of # <eol> expensive medical <eob> imaging technologies to <eol> xxxxxx patients, we started with a # standard, xxxxx xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxx # either <eob> from a DSLR camera <eol> xx a mobile # <eol> xxxxxx xxx the xxxxxxxx
Then xxxxxxxx <eol> billions of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
We xxxxxxxx xxxxx from <eob> the # medical onto this image, <eol> creating something <eob> we a # composite image.
to our surprise, <eol> # <eob> 50 <eol> -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # -- <eol> xx xxxxx # composite to <eob> to xxxx efficiencies.
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of <eol> 10,000 <eob> xxxx # xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eob> we # now # train <eob> the AI algorithms <eol> in xx xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> using only 50 of # these xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> <eol> acquired from # cameras <eob> and mobile <eob> and # provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms # can accept, in the and <eol> even some very simple, # white light <eol> photographs xxxx the patient, instead of expensive xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I xxxxxxx that we xxx # poised <eol> to # enter era <eob> xxxxx # intelligence <eob> is going xx make # incredible <eob> on <eol> our xxxxxxx <eob>

Now, # just # when xxx were # a kid <eob> xxx you'd break <eob> your pencil <eob> xxx # tape back again, <eob> we xxx heal, <eol> but it might not be <eol> in <eob> # most functional way, <eob> xxx we'll a scar. <eob>
# if we xxxxx have <eob> these helper T xxxxxx <eol> instead xx xxxxxxx # muscle, xxx develops fat cells xxxxxx # <eob> of # <eol> xxx if there's # fat our muscle, <eol> it isn't xx # <eob>
Now, using our immune <eob> system, <eol> our # xxxx grow # xxxxxxx # these scars <eob> look # # what # it <eob> we were # even injured.
I'm xxxxxxx xx # create that # give us the signals # <eol> by changing the <eol> response. <eol>
We xxxx that <eob> # <eob> x # xxxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx in <eol> xxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxx system will # to # it. <eob>
This # ranges # xxxx # pacemakers <eob> to insulin pumps the xxxxxxxxx that # engineers are using <eol> # try and xxx # xxxxxxx
xx when I place that # material, <eob> scaffold, in <eob> # the <eol> the xxxxxx # system <eob> x xxxxx environment # of xxxxx and <eol> that <eol> xxx change xxx way <eol> that our xxxx cells behave.
Now, # just like # xxx # weather <eol> xxxxxxx # our daily activities, <eol> like <eob> going for <eob> x run <eob> or staying inside # and # entire # xx show # on Netflix, the immune xxxxxxxxxxx of a scaffold affects the way that <eol> our stem # cells xxxx xxx develop.
xx <eob> we have the xxxxx signals, <eol> say the Netflix signals, <eob> we fat cells instead of xxxxxxx <eol>
These <eol> # scaffolds made <eol> of a variety different things, <eol> from plastics # xxxxxxxxx <eol> derived materials, <eol> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges # that xxx # more or less # porous, <eob> xxxx # of different stiffnesses.
xxx # can even make the materials <eob> xxxxxxx # different signals xxxx time. <eob>
So in other # words, we can xxxxxxxxxxx this Broadway of cells by them # xxx <eol> stage, xxxx <eol> # <eob> that # xxx be changed for # different xxxxxxxx <eol> just like a xxxxxxxx # would change the set <eol> for # "Les # "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx xxxxxxxxx specific types of signals that how # our # body responds to to help # us regenerate. <eob>
In the # future, we could see a # xxxxxxxxx a # moldable xxxxxx filler <eol> xx even a wound-healing vaccine. <eol>
Now, we # aren't xxxxx to up <eob> xxx heal xxxx Wolverine. <eol>
xxxxxxxx not <eob> next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But with xxxxx advances, <eol> and xxxxxxx with # our immune xxxxxx <eob> help # tissue xxx heal wounds, <eol> we could xxxxx seeing <eol> xxxxxxxx xxx market that # # body's defense system <eob> help us regenerate, <eol> maybe # xxx <eob> xxx xx able xx # keep # xxxx a xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

A few # <eob> ago, <eob> # I was working <eob> a bank <eob> that to embark <eob> on a transformation. <eol>
They # xxxxxx their offering xx xx simpler, <eol> more intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>

And there are <eol> between departments. <eol>
Getting done forever. <eol>
xx this xxxx knew xxxx in # xxxxx to <eol> they would have # to improve their time to xxxxxx <eob> by drastically changing <eob> working xx
But how? <eob>
To get some # inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eob> to xx and have # a look at <eol> xxxx seem to <eob> # more innovative, like xxxxxxx Netflix, Spotify, # Zappos. <eol>
I remember how we were walking <eol> halls at # xxx # of in 2014, <eob> a # management and a of bankers. <eol>
We felt # strangers in # land, <eol> surrounded by beanbags xxx xxxxxxx <eol> and lots xx smart, <eol> # employees. <eob>
So then xx <eob> asked, <eol> "How # is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected to xxx an org xxxxxx <eob>
But xxxxxxxx # they used strange <eol> xxxx # names like xxxxxxxx and and "tribes" <eol> to # explain # how they xxxx organized. <eob>
So then we tried to # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx to our xxxxxx
We # <eol> "How many are working xxx you?" <eob> "It depends".

xxxx decides on your priorities?" "It depends". <eol>
# <eol> can xxxxxxx xxx <eob>
# asking for what we thought some of basic of organizations, <eob> xxx was, # "It depends". <eob>
Now, # over <eob> the course that xx <eob> gained a # better <eob> understanding xx xxxxx model.
They believed the # <eol> of small, <eol> autonomous <eol> teams. <eol>
xxxxx teams like <eol>
xxxx xxxxxxx and <eol> IT engineers in the team <eol> so they could design, # build <eol> and test ideas with # customers independently of others the company.
xxxx did not need xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx

Now, <eob> xx end <eol> of xxxx day, <eob> we # xxxxxxx <eol> to xxxxxxx on what xx had learned. <eol>
And # we xxx # started to # like xxxxx model, so # we # already # of how to # apply # # of these ideas # xx a bank. <eob>
But # then, # one of # # hosts, <eob> a guy xxx had not # xxxx a word <eob> all # day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see # you xxxx xxx model. <eob>

Our distributed # work <eol> xxxxxx # xxxxxx accidentally. <eob>
xx was # x # # choice <eol> from the <eol> very xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
I don't use xxx # word xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx it up expectation, <eob> that # people # xxx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where <eob> # everyone <eob> is on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think # a workforce <eob> is the # most effective xxx <eob> to build x # company. <eob>
The key xx # you <eol> have to <eob> approach it # <eol>
When # xx started WordPress, <eob> many # of # the first 20 xxxxx were I'd never # <eob> in person. <eob>
But <eol> xxxx collaborated online, <eob> sometimes for years. <eol>
I # wanted # to # continue # that <eob> xxx simple reason. <eol>
I believe that <eol> # talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eol> # world. But opportunity # not.
In <eol> Valley, <eol> big tech companies fish <eol> from essentially <eol> the small # pond xxxx <eob>
A xxxxxxxxxxx # company <eob> can # fish from the entire <eob> ocean. <eol>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone who grew # xx <eol> in <eob> Japan but lives in you # can gain # someone <eol> who lives, works, <eob> # up goes <eob> # sleep <eob> xxxxxxxx # they # are # the world. <eob> They <eol> xxxxx # a different <eob> understanding that culture <eob> and a # lived # <eol>
At xxx xxxx xx xxx decision to go # distributed, <eol> a desire # give people autonomy xxxx # # they xx xxxxx work. <eol>
you're a # where specific hours are you can make # your xxx schedule. <eol>
Everyone xxx have a corner office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want # eat, <eob> xxx # choose xxxx # music <eob> and # # # silence. <eol>
You can # xxxxxx what temperature <eol> the room xxxxxx # be. <eob>
You can save the xxxx you'd # spend # commuting and put <eol> it xxxx # things <eol> that <eob> are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # <eob> is # # xxxxxxxxxx company.
But often ask me, <eol> "This # xxxxx xxxxx y'all, <eol> about # <eob> everyone xxxxxx <eol> If you <eob> xxxx an office, <eol> xxx can do # # things to distributed capability. <eol>
First: <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> everything. <eob>
In xx office, it's easy <eob> to <eob> xxxx decisions in the moment, <eol> the kitchen, in the <eol>
if people <eol> work remotely <eob> and <eob> some members of the <eol> are xxxxx <eol> they don't have access to, <eol> they'll see these decisions <eol> being made <eol> understanding the why. <eob>
Always <eol> leave # of # you # were and xxx <eob> were about.
This <eol> # allows others # # pick up <eol> where left <eol> off.
allows people in <eob> different <eol> time zones to xxxxxxxxx also great to # think <eol> about <eob> as an organization <eob> people xxxxxxx and people joining.
Try # have # as much # communication <eob> possible xxxxxxx
When # everything's shared xxxxxxx xx allows new <eob> people <eob> to catch up xxxxxxxx <eob>
You need <eol> to xxxx <eob> the right tools. <eol>
are many xxxx and services that with # day-to-day communication, <eob> video <eob> # conferencing, project management.
The things that # changed xxx you xxxx probably aren't # xxxxxxx <eob> # anymore. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxx # xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx your # <eol>
So experiment with different xxxxx collaboration, see # what works. <eob>
Create # productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In a <eob> traditional office, <eol> you're in the # same place 48 # weeks # out of # the year <eob> and # might # or # four apart.
We flip that: we # xxxxxxxx <eol> for # intense bursts. Once a year xx xxxxx # meet-up xxxxx the entire xxxxxxx for week.
It's half-work, half-play.
xxx goal is # people. # want to sure everyone's aligned and # xx xxxx xxxxx and # have a # deeper connection <eol> with <eob> their colleagues. <eol>
When work # together <eol> rest of the year, <eob> they together that # understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the xxxxx practice: give people flexibility to make their xxx work environment. <eol>
Every person <eol> # a co-working # <eol> xxxx they can put <eob> xxxxxxx # a or # xxxx to buy coffee, so # xxxxx <eol> get kicked # out xx # xxx # coffee # <eob>
One in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together and rented a # xxxxxxxxx # a # fishing <eob> xxxxx <eob>
Each person who # # <eol> the company <eob> gets a
This is money they # can invest <eob> in getting xxx right chair, # monitor, xxx # desk so # xxxx have <eol> the most <eob> productive environment xxx them. <eob>
xxxxxx there # just a # few <eol> companies <eol> that are <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
In a or # xxxx <eol> I xxxxxxx that percent of companies <eol> are # # changing <eob> xxx <eol> course of the world <eol> are going # to <eob> # this # way. <eob>
They will # evolve to # distributed # xxxxxx <eol> they'll be replaced by <eob> those xxxx <eob>
As you # xxxxx about xxxxx to xxxxx next, <eol> consider how <eob> xxx can tap <eol> into # global talent, <eob> xxxx # people autonomy to live <eob> where they feel <eob> they # should <eol> participate # fully in whatever <eol> it is <eob> # xxxx you're creating <eob>
