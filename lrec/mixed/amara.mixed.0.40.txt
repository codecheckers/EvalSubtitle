Imagine waking up to a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple <eol> strangers -- <eob> questioning <eob> your right to existence <eob> for something that you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an angry message, <eol> scared and worried for your safety.
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The <eob> kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious <eob> and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.
This kind of harassment keeps women <eol> from <eol> accessing the internet -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a <eol> form of oppression. <eol>
Pakistan is the sixth most populous <eob> country in the world, <eol> with 140 million people having access to mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 percent internet penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't seem to go down <eol> with the rise of new technologies. <eol>
Pakistan is also the birthplace <eob> of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But <eob> that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
Another aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eol> is <eob> linked to women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect <eol> women <eob> and even kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called "family honor"; <eob> where women are left to die <eob> right outside their houses <eol> for speaking <eol> to a man on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor". <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eol> it's not honor; <eob> it's a <eob> cold-blooded murder. <eol>
I come from a very small village <eol> in Punjab, Pakistan, <eob> where women are not allowed <eol> to pursue their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eol> didn't allow their women <eob> to pursue their higher education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, unlike the other <eol> male guardians of my family, <eob> my father was one who really <eol> supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law degree, <eob> of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] frowns <eob> of disapproval. <eol>
But in the end, I knew <eol> it's either me or them, <eob> and I chose myself. <eol>
(Applause) <eob>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for a woman <eol> wouldn't allow me to own a mobile <eol> phone until I was married. <eob>
And even <eol> when I was married, <eob> this tool became a tool <eob> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, <eob> he really didn't approve of this <eob> and threw me out of his house, <eob> along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the time <eol> when I first asked myself, <eob> "Why? <eob>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to enjoy the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our <eob> Constitution? <eol>
While the law states that a woman <eol> has the same equal access to the information, <eob> why is it always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers and husbands -- <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eob> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to take a step, instead of keep questioning <eob> these patriarchal structures <eob> and <eol> societal norms. <eob>
And I founded the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 <eob> to <eol> address all the issues <eob> and women's experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for free and safe internet <eob> to convincing young women <eob> that access to the safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, <eol> human right, <eob> I'm trying to play my part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> to address the questions <eol> that have bothered me <eol> all these years. <eob>
With a hope in my heart, and to offer a solution to this menace, I started Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 -- (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to the women <eol> who do not know who to turn to <eob> when they face serious threats online. <eob>
I think of the women who do not have <eob> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they feel unsafe in online <eob> spaces, <eob> and they go about their daily activities, <eob> thinking that there is <eol> a rape threat in their in-box. <eob>
Safe access to the internet <eol> is an access to knowledge, <eob> and knowledge is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eol> I'm fighting for equality. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
We're at a critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eob> some of our great institutions <eol> are failing us. <eol>
Why? <eob>
In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, <eob> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this is unacceptable.
This has to stop. <eob>
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
How are we going <eol> to choose the right course? <eob>
It's not going to be easy.
For years, I've worked with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen the right objectives <eol> and the wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, <eol> others of them have failed. <eol>
And today I'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's <eob> what's crucial, how and why <eob> they set meaningful and audacious goals, <eol> the right goals for the right reasons. <eob>
Let's go back to 1975. <eob>
Yep, this is me. <eob>
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, <eob> I've got long hair, <eob> but I'm working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the greatest manager <eol> of his or any other era. <eob>
Andy was a superb leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eob> and he said to me, "John, <eob> it almost doesn't matter <eob> what you know. <eob>
Execution is what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy invented a system <eol> called "Objectives and Key Results". <eob>
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
And it's all about excellent execution. <eob>
So here's a classic video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases <eol> of the management by objective systems <eob> are the objectives and the key results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective is the direction.
The key results have to be measured, <eol> but at the end you can look <eol> and without any argument say, <eob> "Did I do that, or did I not do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple.
Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, <eol> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work for teams, they even work for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eol> you <eob> want to <eob> have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going to get that done. <eob>
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's <eol> the truth: <eob> many of us are <eob> setting goals wrong, <eob> and most <eob> of us <eob> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A lot of organizations <eol> set <eob> objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but <eob> they lack a sense of purpose <eol> to inspire their teams. <eob>
So how do you set <eol> these goals the right way?
First, you must answer <eol> the question, "Why?" Why? <eob>
Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions to their passion and to <eob> their purpose, and <eol> they develop a clear <eol> and compelling sense of <eol> why. <eol>
I want to tell you a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. <eob>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eob>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna is a health care data company. <eob>
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they used data to serve the health needs <eol> of lots of workers <eol> at large companies. <eob>
And then two years <eol> into the company's life, <eob> the federal <eol> government issued a proposal <eob> to build the first ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll remember <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our poor, our children <eob> and people with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time was just 15 people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in one year, <eol> and they had a whole set of commitments that they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money on the project. <eob>
This was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, it's a personal why. <eol>
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism. <eob>
And when he was seven, <eob> he had his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland.
He fell <eob> to the ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.
They came to the country <eol> with limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini <eob> to enroll her <eob> family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was nine years old. <eob>
That moment defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved my family <eob> from bankruptcy, <eob> and today it provides for <eob> Kimong's health <eol> and for millions of others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Every row of data is a life <eob> whose story deserves <eol> to be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story <eob> tells us <eob> that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eol> we want to <eob> have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> they are inspiring, <eob> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think a rockstar <eob> would be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, but for years, Bono has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against poverty and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eol> has <eob> focused on two really gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for the poorest countries in the world. <eob>
The next is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eol>
Now, why are these good objectives? <eob>
Let's go back to our checklist. <eob>
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does your passion <eol> lead you to do?
If the <eol> heart doesn't find <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then your passion means nothing.
The OKR framework <eol> cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry contained inside it. <eob>
It gives us an environment for risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing is not a fireable offense. <eob>
And when <eob> you have that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and <eob> the right people, <eob> magic is around the corner. <eob>
JD: I love that. <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic <eob> is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect. <eob>
So with Jini we've covered the whys, <eob> with Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our attention to the hows. <eob>
Remember, the hows <eob> are the key <eol> results. That's how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're aggressive but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, and they're verifiable. <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they are, <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not quite. <eob>
What he really said was, <eob> "We don't have any other way to manage this company, <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.
But every quarter <eob> since then, <eob> every Googler has written down <eol> her objectives and her key results. <eob>
They've graded them, <eob> and they've published them <eol> for everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not <eol> used for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set aside. <eob>
They're used for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's to get collective commitment to truly stretch goals.
In 2008, a Googler, <eob> Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the next generation client platform <eob> for the future of web applications -- <eob> in other words, build the best browser. <eob>
He was very thoughtful <eol> about how he <eob> chose his key results. <eol>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of users, <eob> because users are going to <eob> decide <eob> if Chrome <eob> is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had <eob> this one <eob> three-year-long objective: <eob> build the best browser. <eob>
And then every year <eol> he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped the ante. <eob>
In the first year, <eol> his goal was 20 million users <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He got less than 10. <eob>
Second year, <eob> he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In <eob> the third <eob> year, <eob> he upped the ante once more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eob> marketing campaign, <eob> broader distribution, <eol> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, <eob> but it shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then <eob> sticking to it year after year after year.
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.
Now, I think of OKRs <eob> as transparent vessels <eob> that are made from the whats <eol> and hows of our ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why <eol> that we pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eol> a substitute for a strong culture <eob> or for stronger leadership, but when those fundamentals are in place, <eol> they can take you to the mountaintop.
I want you to think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you have the right metrics? <eob>
Take time to write down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eob>
Do it today. <eob>
If you'd like some feedback on them, <eol> you can <eob> send them to me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eob> access to all the world's information. <eob>
Here's the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eob> is powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been called <eol> the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs <eob> for spreading the good gospel <eol> according to Andy Grove, <eob> but I want you <eol> to join me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight <eob> for what it is <eol> that really matters, <eob> because we can take OKRs beyond our businesses.
We can take them to our families, <eob> to our schools, <eob> even to our governments. <eob>
We can hold those governments accountable. <eol>
We can transform those informations. <eol>
We can get back on the right track <eol> if we can and do measure <eol> what really matters. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
What is history?
It is something written by the winners.
There is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eol> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in many countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eol> that was predetermined <eob> or determined by the leaders, and common people could not <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been or ever will be a truly democratic nation, and this is due to the way <eol> history has been framed to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is not true. <eol>
To <eob> prove it, I spent two years <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year of <eob> the Russian Revolution. <eob>
I asked myself, what if the internet <eob> and Facebook existed 100 years ago? <eob>
So <eob> last year, we built <eol> a social network for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and I created our software, digitized and uploaded <eol> all possible real diaries and letters written by more than 3,000 people 100 years ago. <eob>
So any user of our website or application <eob> can follow a news feed for each day of 1917 <eol> and read what people <eol> like Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova and others thought <eob> and felt. <eob>
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like you and me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eol> of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius <eob> ideas". <eob>
Our project was a shock for many Russians, who used <eob> to think that our country has always been an autocratic empire <eol> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eol> just because democracy <eol> was not our destiny. <eol>
But if we take a broader look, <eol> it's not <eob> that black and white.
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this project, we see that Russia <eol> could have had a different <eob> history <eob> and a democratic future, <eob> as any other country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts from 1917, <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> was the first country in the world <eob> to <eol> abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one of the first ones <eol> to grant women voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced <eob> history <eob> can help us create a better future, because history is just a rehearsal <eol> of what's happening right now. <eol>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eol> and this year, for example, <eob> we started a new online project <eol> that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and that is an online documentary series <eol> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> a year marked by global social change <eob> that, in many ways, <eol> created the world as we know it now.
But we are making that history alive <eob> by imagining what if all the main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eol> just like that?
And we see that a lot of individuals <eob> were facing <eob> the same challenges <eol> and were fighting for the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in USSR <eob> or in France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we show that people in power <eol> are not the only ones making choices. <eol>
That gives any user a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history.
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an impact. <eol>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter. <eob>
We shape society. <eob>
We all make history.
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
Computer algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible <eol> tasks with high accuracies, at a massive scale, using human-like intelligence. <eob>
And this <eol> intelligence of computers <eol> is often referred to as AI or artificial intelligence. <eob>
AI <eob> is poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eol> we still face massive challenges <eol> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of patients every year <eob> lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral cancer. <eob>
Our best way to help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eol> and diagnoses of these diseases.
So how do we detect these diseases today, <eob> and can artificial intelligence help? <eob>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eol> an expert physician first orders <eob> very expensive <eol> medical <eob> imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eol>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to the patient.
As you can see, <eob> this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eob> requiring both expert <eol> physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, and is not considered practical <eob> for the developing world. <eob>
And in fact, in many <eob> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can we solve this problem using artificial intelligence? <eob>
Today, if I were to use traditional <eob> artificial intelligence architectures to solve this problem, <eob> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 of these very expensive medical <eob> images <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would then go to an expert physician, <eob> who would then analyze <eol> those images for me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, I can train a standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's diagnosis. <eol>
Similar to the first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches suffer from the same problem. <eob>
Large amounts of data, expert physicians <eob> and expert medical imaging technologies. <eob>
So, can we invent more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what my <eob> group at MIT Media Lab does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox AI architectures <eob> to solve some of the most important <eob> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical trials.
In the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had <eob> two goals. <eob>
Our first goal was to reduce <eol> the number of images required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we <eol> were more <eob> ambitious, <eol> we wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients. <eol>
So how did we do it? <eol>
For our <eol> first goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> with tens and thousands <eob> of these very expensive medical images, <eol> like traditional AI, <eob> we started with a single medical image. <eol>
From this image, my team and I <eol> figured <eol> out a very clever way <eob> to extract <eob> billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These information packets <eol> included colors, pixels, <eob> geometry <eob> and rendering of the disease on the medical image. <eob>
In a sense, we converted one image <eob> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount of data needed for training. <eob>
For our second goal, <eob> to reduce the use of expensive medical <eol> imaging technologies to screen patients, <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eol> or a mobile <eob> phone, for the patient. <eol>
Then remember those <eol> billions of information <eol> packets? <eol>
We overlaid those from <eol> the medical image onto this image, <eol> creating something <eob> that we call a composite image.
Much to <eob> our surprise, <eol> we only required 50 -- I repeat, only 50 -- <eob> of <eol> these composite images to train <eob> our algorithms to <eol> high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize our approach, <eob> instead <eol> of using 10,000 <eob> very expensive medical images, <eob> we can now train the AI algorithms in an unorthodox <eob> way, <eob> using only 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR cameras and mobile phones, <eob> and provide diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can accept, <eol> in the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, white light <eob> photographs from the patient, <eol> instead of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that we are poised <eol> to enter an era <eol> where artificial intelligence <eob> is going to make an incredible <eol> impact on our future. <eob>
And I think that thinking <eol> about traditional AI, <eob> which is data-rich but application-poor, <eob> we should also continue thinking about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept small amounts of data <eob> and <eol> solve some of the most important <eol> problems facing us today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>
Thank you very much. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What if you could take a pill or a vaccine <eob> and, just like getting over a cold, <eob> you could <eob> heal your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, if we have <eol> an operation or an accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars and painful side effects <eob> of our <eol> inability to regenerate <eob> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eob>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to give us <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines <eol> instruct <eol> our body <eob> to fight disease, <eol> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system <eob> to build <eol> tissues and more quickly heal wounds. <eol>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are several organisms <eob> that can achieve this feat. <eob>
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than <eob> half <eol> of its original mass. <eol>
To <eob> make this magic <eob> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eol> can heal wounds and build tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From a scrape on your knee <eol> to that annoying sinus infection, our immune system defends <eol> our body from danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, <eol> and by using what I know <eol> about our body's defense system, <eob> I was able to identify key players <eob> in our fight to build back <eob> our cuts and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being tested <eol> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed that after treating <eol> an injured muscle <eob> with these materials, <eob> there was <eob> a large number of immune cells <eob> in that <eol> material <eol> and the surrounding muscle.
So in this case, <eob> instead <eob> of the immune cells rushing off <eob> towards infection to fight bacteria, <eol> they're rushing toward an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eob> type of immune cell, <eob> the helper T cell, <eob> was present inside <eol> that material that I implanted <eob> and absolutely critical <eob> for wound healing. <eol>
Now, just like when you were a kid <eob> and you'd break your pencil <eol> and try and tape it back together again, <eob> we can heal, <eob> but it might not be <eol> in the most functional way, <eol> and we'll get a scar. <eob>
So if we don't have these helper T cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eol> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells inside of it, and if there's fat in our muscle, <eol> it isn't as strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, <eol> our body could <eob> grow back without these scars <eob> and look like what it was <eol> before we were even injured.
I'm <eol> working to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know that any time <eol> a material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will respond to it. <eob>
This ranges from <eob> pacemakers <eol> to insulin pumps <eol> to the materials that engineers are using <eol> to try and build new tissue. <eob>
So when I place that material, or <eol> scaffold, in the body, the immune system creates <eol> a small environment of cells and proteins <eob> that can <eob> change the way <eol> that our stem cells behave. <eob>
Now, <eob> just like the weather <eol> affects our daily activities, <eol> like going for <eol> a run or staying inside and binge-watching <eob> an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold <eob> affects the way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix signals, <eol> we get fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eob> of a variety of different things, from plastics to naturally <eol> derived materials, <eob> nanofibers of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more <eol> or less porous, <eob> gels of different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers <eol> can even make the materials <eob> release different signals over time. <eob>
So in other words, we can orchestrate <eol> this Broadway show of cells <eol> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed for different tissues, just like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm combining specific types of signals <eob> that mimic how our body responds to injury <eob> to help us regenerate. <eob>
In the future, we could see <eol> a scar-proof band-aid, <eob> a moldable muscle filler <eob> or even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't going to wake up tomorrow <eol> and be able to heal like Wolverine. <eol>
Probably not next Tuesday, either. <eol>
But with these advances, <eob> and working with our immune <eob> system <eol> to help <eob> build tissue and heal wounds, <eol> we could begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's <eob> defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able <eol> to keep pace with a salamander.
Thank you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
So, as a child, <eob> I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer <eol> days, <eol> I would dash across the floor <eob> and <eol> stick my face in front of <eob> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one in our community. <eob>
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed <eob> normal to me. <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get warm, my neighbors would have no choice <eol> but to bypass the <eob> meter <eob> after their heat was shut off, <eob> just to keep their family <eol> comfortable for one more day. <eob>
These kinds of dangerous <eob> incidents <eol> can take root <eob> when people are faced <eob> with <eob> impossible choices. <eob>
In the US, the average American spends <eol> three percent of their income on energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, even 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In 2015, this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eol> to provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy becomes a burden. <eob>
But energy burdens are so much more <eob> than just a number. <eob>
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to get her flu medicine, <eol> or do you feed <eob> her? <eob>
Or do you keep her warm? <eob>
It's an impossible choice, <eol> and nearly every month, <eob> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and systemic issue. <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into the mass of 37 million people a year <eob> who are unable to afford energy <eol> for their most basic needs.
As a result, those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like heart disease and asthma.
Look -- given our rockets to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have the tools to address <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eol>
Cost of renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
However, even as we approach cost parity, <eob> the majority of those who own solar <eol> earn much more than <eob> the average American. <eol>
This is why, when <eol> I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, <eob> utilities and government agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eob>
But there's no one way to solve this.
I believe in the power <eol> of <eob> local communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eob> of relationships.
So we start by working directly <eol> with the communities <eol> that have the highest energy <eob> burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eol> and events for communities <eob> to <eob> learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how making even small <eol> updates to their homes <eol> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to <eol> community solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation programs <eob> to help families bring <eob> down <eol> their energy bills.
We're even working directly <eob> with elected officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision of energy equity <eob> and resilience succeed, <eol> we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but they're only able to help a fraction of those in need. <eob>
In <eob> fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not sustainable. <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eob> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At scale, microgrid technology, clean technology and energy efficiency <eol> dramatically improve public health. <eob>
And for those with high energy burdens, <eob> it can help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent of their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a person's income who's struggling to make ends meet. <eob>
This is life-changing. <eob>
This is an opportunity <eol> for families to use their energy savings <eob> to sponsor their future. <eob>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eol> and her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eol> that <eol> they had to make and the <eol> effect it had <eol> on our whole community. <eob>
But this <eob> is not just about them. <eob>
There are millions nationwide <eol> having <eob> to make the same impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eob> are a tremendous barrier to overcome, <eob> but through relationships with communities and technology, <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eol>
And when we do, <eob> we will all be more resilient. <eob>
Thank you.
(Applause) <eob>
Have you ever <eob> watched <eol> a flock of birds work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating? <eol>
What I <eol> find remarkable is that these birds <eob> would not be able to do that <eob> if they all would have <eol> to follow one leader. <eol>
Their reaction <eob> speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned on <eol> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird <eol> to make autonomous decisions <eob> while <eob> still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
Their alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible.
Now, what does this have to do with any one of us?
Well, it's one way of <eol> illustrating what <eol> I believe to be the <eob> most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more <eol> complex, <eob> so we need a new way of working, a way that creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eol> that takes out bureaucracy and that truly empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eol>
But the question is: <eol> In order to get there, what are we willing to give up? <eob>
A few years ago, I was working with a bank <eob> that wanted to embark <eol> on a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many of you <eol> have seen a bank from the inside, so let me try to illustrate <eol> what many traditional banks look like. <eol>
You see lots of people in suits <eob> taking <eob> elevators to go to their department, <eob> marketers sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc. <eol>
You see meetings with 20 people <eob> where nothing gets decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They end up <eob> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever.
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to transform, <eob> they would have <eob> to improve <eol> their time to market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their ways of working as well.
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> to go and have a look at companies <eob> that seem to be more innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And I remember how we were walking <eob> the halls at one of these companies <eob> in December 2014, <eol> a management consultant <eob> and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt like strangers in a strange land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags and hoodies <eob> and lots of smart, creative employees. <eol>
So then we asked, <eob> "How is your company organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an org chart.
But <eol> instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> to explain how they were organized.
So then we tried to translate <eol> that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, "How many people <eob> are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eol>
"Who decides on your priorities?" "It depends". <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for what we <eob> thought <eol> were some of the basic principles <eol> of organizations, <eob> and their answer was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, over the course of that day, <eob> we gained a better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had <eob> product people <eol> and IT engineers in the same team so they could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently of others in the company. <eob>
They did not need handovers between departments. <eob>
They had all the skills needed <eob> right there in the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eob> to reflect on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started to like their model, so we were already thinking of how <eol> to apply some of these ideas to a bank. <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> a guy who had not said a word all day, <eob> he suddenly said, <eob> "So I see you like our model. <eob>
But I have one question for you: <eob> What are you willing to give up?" <eob> What were we <eob> willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we knew he was right. <eob>
Change is not only about <eol> embracing <eol> the new; <eob> it's about giving up <eol> on some of the <eob> old as well. <eol>
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I have worked with companies <eol> all over the world <eob> to change their ways of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> has their own skeptics <eob> about why this is not going to work for them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eol> or "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for this bank and also <eol> for <eob> the other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we completely <eol> blew up the old silos between marketing, product, channels and <eob> IT.
Three thousand employees were reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just with product people <eob> and <eol> engineers with engineers, a product person <eob> and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same team. <eob>
You could be a member of a team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At <eob> the go-live date <eob> of that new organization, <eob> some people were shaking hands <eol> for the very first <eob> time, <eob> only to find out that they <eob> had been <eob> sitting two minutes away from each other <eob> but they <eol> were <eol> sending each other emails <eol> and status reports <eob> for the last 10 years. <eob>
You would hear <eol> someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy that I <eol> was always chasing for answers". <eol> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're having coffee <eol> together every day. <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just raise it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eol> who is sitting right next to him. <eob>
They can decide to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, <eol> no red tape, <eob> just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, getting there is not easy. <eol>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What are you willing to give <eob> up?" <eob> is exactly the right question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up and <eol> down the organization, we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to do so, we need all the skills <eob> and expertise for that decision <eob> in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate <eob> our people <eol> who are working in different <eob> buildings, <eob> different cities or even <eol> different countries today?
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way we do things <eob> across these teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eol> of management matrix.
Now, all these changes to structure <eol> and process and procedure -- <eob> they are not easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eob>
Let me try to illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams <eob> to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, <eob> like a mini-start-up, <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot have leaders <eob> commanding their people what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eol>
No <eol> micromanagers. <eol>
But it also means that each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eol> regardless of their formal title. <eol>
It's about all of us stepping up <eol> to take initiative. <eob>
Now <eol> obviously, we also cannot afford <eol> to have all these teams <eol> running in different directions, <eob> because <eob> that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos.
So we need alignment and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eob> just like a flock <eol> of birds. <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new behavior, <eob> there is giving up on something old as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> that everyone in the organization <eob> is aligned around <eol> the overall purpose -- the why -- <eol> and the overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
But then they have to let go <eol> and trust their teams <eob> to make the right decisions <eol> on how to get there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But <eob> you know how they say <eob> that information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some <eol> managers, <eob> sharing information may feel as if <eol> they're giving up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently as well. <eob>
In these companies, the teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and at the end of every sprint, <eol> they organize a demo session <eob> to share the <eob> output <eob> of what they've done, transparently. <eob>
And every day, <eob> each member of the team gives an update <eol> of what they are working on individually. <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable for people, because suddenly, there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, alignment is not easy, <eob> and providing autonomy <eob> is not so obvious, either.
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain how he used <eob> to be a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
Now, today, to know how things are going, <eob> instead of looking at status reports, <eol> he needs to walk down <eob> to the team floors <eol> to attend one of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help them. <eob>
That is radical change <eob> for someone who used to be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the <eol> old world, this executive said, <eob> "I only had the illusion of control. <eob>
In <eob> reality, many projects would run over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, <eol> and I can course-correct <eol> much earlier if needed".
And middle managers <eol> need to change as well. <eol>
First of all, without the handovers <eob> and the <eob> PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a need <eol> for middle managers. <eol>
And in the old world, there was <eol> this idea of thinkers and doers. <eob>
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of only <eob> managing other people, <eol> middle managers were expected <eol> to become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been telling <eob> other people what to do, but now you're expected to do things yourself again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, and some great people leave the company. <eob>
But the result is a new culture with less hierarchy. <eob>
And all of this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth it. <eob>
The companies that I worked with, <eob> they were <eob> used to deploying <eol> new product features a few times per year. <eob>
Now they <eob> have releases every few weeks, and without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And finally, if you walk the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the halls <eol> of a very large start-up. <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eol> they cannot claim victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of that change <eol> is not in structure <eol> or process or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just senior executives taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of those <eol> in the organization <eob> who <eol> embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change. <eob>
So the question is: <eob> What are you willing to give up?
Thank you. <eol>
(Applause)
A leader is steady, firm, <eol> decisive, unwavering. <eob>
Never let 'em see you sweat, always have an answer. <eob>
[The Way We Work] My <eol> name is Dan, I'm a partner <eob> at a global creative consultancy. <eob>
But there's another side to me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, the character I created on Instagram. <eob>
As I thought about my double life, <eol> I couldn't help but wonder ... <eob>
When your true self <eol> is a little nontraditional, <eob> how much of it can you really <eol> bring to the office? <eol>
For some of us is authenticity off-limits? <eob>
For the first 10 years of my career, <eol> I thought there was <eol> one way to be a leader: <eob> decisive and serious. <eob>
But that's not me. <eob>
So I'd put on <eol> basically <eol> office drag to fit the role: <eob> I'd talk in a deeper voice, <eol> try to hold in my hand motions.
I'm someone who gets <eol> really excited about things, so I'd temper that. <eob>
I had this little voice <eol> in my head, telling me, <eob> "You're too gay, <eol> too feminine, too flamboyant". <eob>
I had one well-intentioned adviser who said, <eol> "Everyone knows <eob> you're gay. <eol> And that's great. <eob>
But you don't need to beat them <eol> over the head with it". <eob>
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016. <eob>
I dressed up as my favorite <eol> TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw, <eob> thinking my friends <eol> would get a kick out of it. <eob>
And then, things got crazy.
The post went viral, <eol> and at first it was pure fun. <eob>
I started getting these incredible <eol> messages from people <eob> about how happy it made them, how it encouraged them <eol> to be their authentic selves. <eob>
And I started to think, <eob> maybe this is the time to tell that <eol> little voice in my head to just shut up <eob> and let myself be me. <eob>
But then things got a little <eob> too big. <eob>
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere -- <eol> In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" -- <eob> and I got terrified: <eob> "What would my <eob> bosses think? <eob>
Would my coworkers <eol> still respect me as a leader? <eob>
What would my clients think?" <eob> I thought I was going to have to <eol> get a different job.
But then, something happened, <eol> something <eol> small. <eob>
I got a text from my boss, it wasn't long, it just said, <eob> "Wow, Cosmo!" <eob> With a link to an article <eol> that <eob> had <eol> just <eob> gone up about me. <eob>
And it let me put that little, <eol> scared voice away <eob> and just be excited <eol> about this whole new world, <eob> rather than freaked out. <eob>
That's the power of one person, <eob> sometimes all it takes is one ally <eol> to make you feel comfortable. <eob>
And my coworkers <eol> started acting differently.
They became more open, <eob> more playful with me, <eob> it was as if knowing this other side of me <eob> gave them permission <eol> to be more of <eob> themselves as well. <eob>
I thought that openness and vulnerability <eol> would actually decrease <eol> my standing with my team. <eol>
But it's done the opposite. <eob>
Two years in, <eob> I never could have imagined that this <eol> part of me would not just be embraced, <eob> but could actually help my career.
Now, I'm lucky. <eob>
I work in New York City, <eol> in an office where creativity is valued <eob> and I was already <eob> pretty established <eol> in my career when all of this started. <eob>
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't. <eob>
But all of this has taught me so <eob> much <eob> about just the importance <eob> of bringing your whole self to work. <eob>
And it's really challenged <eol> my own misperceptions about what it takes to be successful. <eob>
There's no one kind of way to be a leader. <eob>
It's about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them. <eob>
Before, if a meeting was hard, <eob> I'd put on my perfect leader mask. <eob>
Now, I can say, "Gosh, that was <eob> frustrating". <eob>
We can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way, <eob> rather than everybody <eob> pretending <eob> that they're fine until it's too late. <eob>
Concealing an identity takes work. <eob>
Think of all the wasted energy <eol> spent pretending, <eob> wishing <eob> you were someone different. <eob>
What's most interesting to me, though, <eol> is that in this big study of covering, <eob> 93 percent of those <eol> who say they're doing it <eob> also believe their organization <eol> values inclusion. <eob>
So clearly, our workplaces <eob> and all of our strange inner voices <eol> have a long way to go on acceptance. <eol>
There's a big difference <eol> between adapting and disguising. <eob>
And I think I learned that a little late. <eol>
Personally, I'm taking all of this <eol> as a call to <eob> be the ally <eob> who, like my boss did for <eol> me, <eob> lets people know that it's OK to open up. <eob>
If you're gay, or proud <eol> of your ethnic background, <eob> or have a disability <eol> or are deeply religious, <eob> see what it's like <eol> being your full self at work. <eob>
You might be pleasantly surprised. <eob>
The basic problem <eob> with working in an office <eob> is you're just not in control <eol> of your work environment. <eob>

Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. <eol>
Some of <eol> them choose not even <eol> to have a home base, they're nomads. <eob>
Whether they are in RVs <eob> or traveling through Airbnbs, <eob> they are in new places <eol> every day, week or month. <eol>
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. <eol>
Our focus on distributed work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious choice <eol> from the <eob> very beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't use the word "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eol> that some people are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eol> where <eol> everyone is <eol> on an equal playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> is the most effective <eol> way <eol> to build a company. <eob>
The key is you have to approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many of the first <eob> 20 hires <eol> were people I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes <eob> for years. <eob>
I wanted to continue that <eol> for one simple reason. <eob>
I believe that talent and intelligence are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. But opportunity is not. <eob>
In Silicon Valley, the big tech companies fish <eob> from essentially <eol> the same small pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eol> can fish from the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone who grew up <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who lives, works, wakes up and goes to sleep <eol> wherever they are in the world. <eob> They bring a different <eol> understanding of that culture <eob> and a different lived experience. <eob>
At the base of the decision to go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over how they do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a role where specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own schedule. <eob>
Everyone can have a corner office, <eol> their windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you can choose when there's <eob> music <eol> and when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eob> the room should be. <eob>
You can save the time you'd spend commuting <eob> and put it into things that are important to you. <eol>
A distributed workforce <eol> is ideal for a technology company. <eob>
But people often ask me, <eol> "This works <eob> great for y'all, but what about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, <eob> you can do a <eob> few things <eol> to build distributed capability.
First: document everything. <eol>
In an office, it's easy <eob> to make decisions in the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the hall. <eob>
But if people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team are having those conversations <eob> they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail of where <eob> you were <eol> and what <eol> you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It allows people in different <eol> time zones to interact, it's also great to think about <eol> as an organization evolves, people leaving and people joining. <eob>
Try to have as much communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and public, <eol> it allows new people to catch up quickly. <eol>
You also need to find the right tools. <eol>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help with day-to-day communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
The things that changed how you work <eob> probably aren't objects anymore. <eob>
They're things you <eob> access <eol> through your computer. <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what <eob> works. <eob>
Create productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional office, you're in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out of the year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks apart. <eol>
We try to flip that: we come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company <eol> comes together for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary goal is connecting people. We want to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on the same page, <eob> and they have a deeper connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When <eol> they work together <eol> the <eob> rest of the year, they can bring together that understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final practice: <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eob>
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend <eob> that they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy coffee, so they don't <eol> get kicked out of the coffee shop. <eob>
One group in Seattle <eol> decided to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person who joins the company gets a home-office stipend. <eol>
This is money they can invest in <eob> getting the right chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so they can have <eob> the most productive <eol> environment for them. <eob>
Today, there are just a few companies <eol> that are distributed first.
In a decade or two, <eol> I predict that 90 <eob> percent of companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eob> the <eol> course of the world <eob> are going to function <eob> this way. <eob>
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eob> or they'll be replaced by those that are.
As you think about <eol> what you're going to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap into global talent, <eob> give people autonomy to live and work <eol> where they feel they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eob>
