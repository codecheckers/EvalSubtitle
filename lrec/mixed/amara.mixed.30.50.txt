Imagine waking up to # a stranger xx sometimes multiple strangers # -- <eob> questioning your right to <eob> for something that # you wrote online, <eob> waking up to an # <eob> scared # and worried <eob> for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx <eol> world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of # harassment that women <eob> xxxx in # xxxxxxxx is very # serious and leads sometimes xxxxxx outcomes. <eob>
This kind # of xxxxxxxxxx women accessing # xxx internet # -- <eob> essentially, knowledge.
It's a form of # oppression.
Pakistan xx the <eob> sixth <eob> most populous <eob> xxxxxxx in the world, with 140 million people having access <eol> to mobile <eol> technologies, and 15 # <eob> percent penetration. <eob>
And this number doesn't to go xxxx <eol> with the # rise of new # technologies. <eol>
Pakistan is also xxx birthplace <eol> # xxx # youngest # Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eol>
# that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eol>
xxxxxxx aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor <eol> is # linked xx # women # their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect # women and # even # kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called # "family <eob> honor"; <eob> where women are xxxx to die right outside their # houses for speaking to # x man # on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family honor".
Let me xxx this very clearly: <eob> it's # not # honor; it's cold-blooded
I come from a # very small village <eol> in Punjab, # Pakistan, <eob> where are <eob> not # allowed <eol> pursue <eob> their higher education. <eob>
The elders # of my extended <eol> didn't allow their women <eol> to pursue xxxxxx education <eol> or professional careers. <eol>
However, unlike the # other <eol> male guardians of # my family, <eob> my <eob> father one xxx <eob> really <eob> my <eol> ambitions. <eob>
To get my law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] xxxxxx of disapproval. <eob>
But # in the end, I knew it's xxxxxx me or them, <eob> and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
My family's traditions <eol> and expectations for <eol> a woman <eob> # allow # me xx own a mobile <eol> phone until x was married. <eob>
And # xxxx when x # married, tool became a <eob> for my # surveillance. <eol>
When I resisted idea <eol> of being surveilled my <eob> he # really didn't approve of this <eob> xxx threw out of xxx house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eob> son, Abdullah.
And was the time <eol> xxxx I first xxxxx myself, "Why? <eol>
Why are women not allowed <eol> to # enjoy # <eob> the xxxxx rights enshrined <eol> in our Constitution? <eob>
While the law that <eol> a woman has the same equal access <eol> xx the information, <eob> why is # always <eob> men -- brothers, fathers # and husbands xx <eob> # <eob> xxx granting these rights # to us, <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx making the # law irrelevant?" <eol>
So I to take a # step, <eob> instead of xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> these patriarchal <eob> and societal <eob>
I founded the xxxxxxx Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eol> to address all the # issues <eol> and women's # in online spaces <eob> and # cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx lobbying # free and safe internet <eob> to <eob> convincing young # women <eob> that xxxxxx to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eol> I'm trying to <eob> my <eol> part <eol> in igniting the spark <eob> xx address xxx questions <eob> that xxxx bothered me xxx these years. <eob>
With a hope in xx <eob> and to offer a solution <eol> to menace, <eol> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December 2016 xx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx
xx extend my # support # to xxx women xxx not xxxx who # xx turn to <eob> face xxxxxxx # threats # online. <eob>
I think # xx the xxx do # xxx have <eol> the necessary support <eob> to deal with the mental trauma <eol> xxxx feel unsafe in online xxxxxxx <eob> xxx <eob> they <eob> xx about xxxxx activities, <eob> thinking # that there is x rape # threat their in-box. <eol>
access to the internet <eol> an # access to xxx # xxxxxxxxx xx freedom. <eob>
When I fight <eob> for women's digital rights, <eob> I'm # for equality. <eob>

We're at a xxxxxxxx # moment. <eol>
xxxxxxxx <eob> xx our # xxxxx institutions <eob> are failing us. <eob>
Why? <eol>
In some # cases, because they're <eob> or but often, they've taken <eol> to the objectives. <eol>
And this is #
This has to # <eob>
How are we going to # correct these wrongs? <eob>
How <eob> # we xx choose <eob> xxx right course?
xxxx not xxxxx to easy. <eob>
xxx # I've with talented teams <eob> and they've chosen # the right objectives <eol> and # the wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded, <eol> xxxxxx of them failed. <eob>
And xxxxx I'm # to share with <eob> what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's xxxxxx crucial, <eob> how and why <eob> they # set meaningful and xxxxxx <eob> the <eob> xxxxx xxxxx the <eob>
Let's go # back # xxxxx <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've a lot to learn, <eob> xxx a computer <eol> # engineer, I've # got long <eol> hair, <eob> but I'm # working under Andy xxxxxx <eol> who's been xxxxxx the greatest manager <eol> of # his <eob> or # any other <eob>
Andy a superb # leader <eob> and also a teacher, <eob> he said to # xxx <eob> # "John, <eol> it almost doesn't matter what xxx know. <eob>
is # what matters # the most". <eob>
And # xx # invented a system called "Objectives # and # <eob>
It kind of rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxxx xxxxx excellent execution.
So x xxxxxxx video from the 1970s <eob> of professor Andy Grove.
(Video) Andy Grove: # The two key phrases <eob> of the xxxxxxxxxx by objective systems <eob> xxx the objectives the key results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective xx xxx
The key results have xx xxxxxxxxx but at # xxx end you <eob> xxx look xxx without # any argument say, <eol> "Did # I that, or did I # do that?" <eol> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
xxxx Doerr: <eob> That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple.
Objectives and Key <eob> Results, or # OKRs, <eob> are <eob> a simple goal-setting system and they work for # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx they work for teams, they # even work for individuals. <eol>
The objectives are what you # to have # accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eob> I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. <eol> Key results.
and how. <eob>
But here's <eob> many of us are setting goals wrong, <eob> most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A # lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they introduce their new products, <eob> they make their <eob> but they lack a xxxxx of xxxxxxx <eol> to inspire teams. <eol>
So how do you set <eol> xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx way? <eol>
First, # you must xxxxxx <eol> the question, "Why?" <eob> <eob>
Because combine xxxxx ambitions <eol> to their passion and to purpose, <eob> and # develop a # clear <eol> and compelling sense of <eob>
I want tell # a story. <eob>
I work with a remarkable <eob>
Her name xx xxxx Kim. <eob>
She runs a company xxxxxx Nuna. <eob>
# is health xxxx data company. <eol>
And when Nuna was <eol> # founded, they used data to serve health needs <eol> of lots of workers at large companies. <eol>
And # xxxx two # years <eol> into the company's xxxxx <eob> the xxxxxxx issued a build the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll xxxxxxxx <eol> that Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, <eob> our poor, our children <eob> and people # with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time # was just 15 # people <eol> and database <eol> had to xx # built in one # year, <eol> and they a whole set of <eol> that they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, weren't <eob> going <eol> to make <eol> very much money on # project. <eob>
This xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx moment, <eol> and Jini # seized it.
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She not <eol> flinch. <eol>
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal <eob>
xxxxxx younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when # he was seven, <eob> xx # had # his first grand mal seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell to xxx ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are immigrants.
They # came to the <eol> with limited resources speaking <eob> little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> enroll her family in Medicaid. <eob>
She was xxxx years # old. <eol>
That <eol> moment <eol> defined her xxxxxxxx <eob> and <eob> that <eob> mission became her company, <eol> and xxxx company bid on, # <eob> and delivered on # that contract.
Here's Jini to tell you why.
(Video) Jini # Kim: Medicaid <eol> saved xx xxxxxx from # bankruptcy, <eob> and today it xxxxxxxx # for Kimong's health <eol> and # millions of others. <eob>
Nuna # xx xx xxxx # letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every row of data is # a <eob> life <eol> whose story deserves <eob> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story xx <eob> that # a xxxxxxxxxx sense of why <eol> xxx <eob> # be for our <eob>
Remember, that's what <eob> we want to <eol> have accomplished. <eob>
And xxxxxxxxxx are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, are <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You xxxxx a <eob> be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key <eob> but # for years, Bono <eob> # has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eol> against <eob> poverty # and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization has on two really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eol>
The first is debt relief <eol> for <eob> xxx # poorest countries in <eob> the world. <eol>
The next is xxxxxxxxx access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs.
Now, # why <eob> are these # good objectives? <eob>
Let's <eol> go back xxx <eob>
Significant? Check. xxxxxxxxx # Yes.
Yes. <eob>
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
xxxxxxx xxxxx So you're passionate? <eol>
How # passionate? <eob>
What actions does your # passion <eob> lead xxx <eob>
If the # heart <eol> doesn't xxxx <eol> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then # xxxx passion means nothing. <eol>
OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the chemistry xxxxxxxxx inside # it. <eob>
It gives us # an environment for risk, <eob> <eob> where xxxxxxx is not <eob> a offense. <eol>
And when that sort <eob> of structure and environment <eol> and the right xxxxxxx magic is around # the xxxxxxx
JD: I love that. <eob>
xxxx the madness, and magic is right around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
with Jini covered the <eol> Bono the whats <eob> of goal-setting.
turn our attention xx the hows. <eob>
the the xxx results. <eob> we meet our # objectives. <eol>
And good results <eol> specific <eob>
They're aggressive realistic.
xxxxxxx # measurable, <eol> they're <eol>
Those are good key <eob> results. <eob>
1999, I introduced OKRs <eol> to xxxxxxxx cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they xxxx <eol> 24 xxxxx old in their garage. <eob>
And xxxxxx enthusiastically said he'd adopt # them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eol>
xxxx # he really # said was, <eob> "We don't # have # any other xxx <eol> to this xxxxxxxx <eob> so we'll # it a go". <eol> (Laughter) <eob>
And # x took xxxx # as a kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since # then, <eob> every Googler has xxxxxxx <eol> her objectives and key results. <eob>
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've published <eol> everyone to see. <eob>
And these are not <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set xxxxxx <eob>
They're used x higher purpose, xxx to xxx # collective # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> to truly # stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a <eol> # Googler, xxxxxx Pichai, <eol> took # on xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> which was <eob> to <eol> the # next generation xxxxxx platform <eob> for # the # future xx web applications -- <eob> # words, build the best browser. <eob>
xx was # thoughtful <eol> how # he chose key results. <eob>
How measure the best browser? <eob>
It be ad # xx engagement.
xxx He said: numbers users, <eob> because users are # going decide <eob> if Chrome is a great browser or not.
So he had one <eol> three-year-long objective: xxxxx the xxxx # browser. <eob>
And then every he stuck to the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped xxx ante. <eob>
xx # the first year, his was 20 million users <eob> he xxxxxx it. <eob>
He # less 10.
Second year, he # raised <eol> the bar to million. <eol>
xx got to 37 <eob> million users. <eob>
Somewhat better. <eol>
In # the third year, he upped xxx ante xxxx more <eol> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive marketing campaign, <eol> broader improved the technology, and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 xxxxxxx users. <eob>
why # I like this story, <eob> so much for the # ending, <eob> it xxxxx # <eol> choosing the right objective <eob> and then <eob> xxxxxxxx to <eol> year after year after year. <eob>
It's a xxxxxxx story for a # xxxx like me. <eol>
Now, I think xx OKRs <eol> as vessels that are made from the whats <eol> hows of # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the <eol> why <eol> that we # pour into those vessels.
That's why we # do our work. <eol>
are # a bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eol> a # substitute for a <eob> # strong culture <eob> or for stronger # leadership, but # when <eob> those fundamentals are in place, <eol> xxxx # can take xxx to mountaintop. <eob>
I xxxx xx think <eol> about life # a moment. <eob>
Do you <eob> right xxxxxxxx <eob>
Take time to # <eob> write down xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> your objectives and your results. <eob>
it <eob>
you'd like some feedback # on # them, you them to me. <eob>

What is # history? <eob>
It is something # written by the winners. <eol>
xxxxx is # stereotype that # history should be focused <eob> on the rulers, like Lenin or <eob>
As a # result, people <eol> many like # Russia, <eob> xxxx at history as something <eol> that <eob> # was predetermined xx determined # by the xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could # not <eol> in any # way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia could ever have been or ever be a <eol> democratic nation, <eob> and <eob> this is to the way has been framed <eob> to the xxxxxxxx of Russia. <eob>
And this xx not <eob> true. <eol>
xx prove it, I spent two years my xxxx trying to go 100 years <eob> back, <eob> # the year # the of the Revolution. <eob>
I # asked # myself, if the <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx # 100 years ago? <eob>
So # last year, we xxxxx <eob> a network for dead <eob> named <eob> Project1917.com. <eol>
My team and x created our # software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eob> xxx possible real <eob> diaries and <eob> letters <eol> xxxxxxx # more people <eol> years ago. <eob>
So any xx our website xx application <eob> can follow # a news feed <eob> for each day of # xxxx xxxx what people <eol> like Stravinsky or <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx thought # and xxxxx <eob>
We <eob> watch all those xxxxxxxxxxxxx # ordinary people like you and # me, not demigods, <eob> and we see xxxx history <eob> consists <eol> of their mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not only their "genius ideas". <eob>
Our project <eol> was a xxxxx for xxxx Russians, who used to xxxxx that our country <eol> has always # been an autocratic empire <eob> and xxx <eob> ideas of freedom democracy <eol> could # never have # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> just # democracy <eol> xxx not our # destiny. <eob>
But if take x <eob> broader look, <eob> it's not that xxxxx and white. <eol>
Yes, 1917 # led to # 70 xxxxx <eol> of <eol> communist dictatorship. <eob>
But with this xxxxxxxx we # # that Russia <eol> could xxx a different history <eob> and a democratic future, <eol> xx any xxxxx country could <eob> # still can. <eol>
Reading # the xxxxx from xxxxx <eob> you xxxxx that xxxxxx <eol> was xxx first country # xx the # xxxxx abolish # the death # xxxxxxxx <eol> or one of first ones <eol> to grant # women voting xxxxxxx <eob>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can us create a better # future, <eob> because <eob> just a xxxxxxxxx of # what's happening right xxxx <eob>
We do need new # ways of # telling <eob> and year, example, <eob> we a new project <eol> that is # called 1968Digital.com, <eob> and is series <eol> that gives you an impression <eol> of that year, # 1968, year marked <eob> xx global social xxxxxx that, in many ways, <eol> created the xxxxx as we know <eol> now. <eob>
xxx we # are making that history # alive <eol> by imagining xxxx if all main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we # see that a lot of individuals <eob> were <eol> facing # the same <eob> challenges <eol> and # were fighting for the same # values, <eob> no matter if <eob> they lived <eol> # or in <eob> or in France or xx China <eob> or Czechoslovakia. <eol>
By exposing history <eob> in such democratic way, <eob> through social media, <eob> we # show that people in power <eol> not the only xxxx xxxxxx # choices. <eob>
xxxx # gives xxx user possibility <eol> reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eob>
They have an xxxxxxx

Computer algorithms # today <eol> are performing incredible tasks with high accuracies, at a xxxxxxx scale, <eol> using human-like <eob>
And this intelligence xx xxxxxxxxx is often <eol> to as AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
AI is # poised to make an incredible impact <eob> on our lives # xx the future. <eob>
Today, <eol> we still <eob> face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several illnesses, <eob> xxxx as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands xx patients every year lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral
best way to help these patients <eob> is to perform xxxxx detection <eol> and # of these diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, can artificial intelligence help? <eol>
In patients who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected of # these diseases, <eol> an <eob> expert # physician xxxxx orders <eob> expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # <eob> to # be performed. <eob>
those images are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> another xxxxxxxxx xxxx # diagnoses # images to <eob> the patient. <eol>
As you can xxxx # xxxx is <eob> a very # <eol> resource-intensive process, <eol> expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical # technologies, <eol> and # is not considered practical <eol> for the xxxxxxxxxx
And in xxxxx in xxxx <eol> industrialized # nations, as well. <eob>
So, we # solve this <eol> problem <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # were # to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures to <eob> this problem, <eob> I would require # 10,000 -- <eob> I # repeat, on an order of xxxxxx <eol> of very expensive medical xxxxxx <eob> first to be generated. <eol>
After # xxxxx I would <eob> then # go <eol> to <eol> physician, <eol> who then # analyze <eol> those xxxxxx xxx me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, I # can <eob> train <eob> a standard # <eob> deep neural xxxxxxx <eol> or a xxxx learning network <eob> to xxxxxxx # patient's # <eob>
Similar # # xxx approach, <eol> traditional artificial <eob> intelligence # approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same <eol>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert xxxxxxxxxx and expert medical technologies. <eob>
So, can xx invent # more effective <eob> and xxxx # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve xxxxx very <eob> problems facing <eob> xx today? <eob>
And is exactly <eol> what group xx MIT xxxxx does.
We have invented <eob> a <eol> variety <eol> of unorthodox architectures <eob> to solve some xx the # xxxx important <eob> challenges facing us today <eob> xx # medical imaging and # clinical xxxxxxx <eob>
In the example I <eol> with xxx today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first was xx reduce <eol> the number of images <eob> required to <eob> train <eol> artificial intelligence # algorithms. <eol>
Our second goal -- we <eob> were more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # reduce the # use <eol> of expensive medical imaging <eob> technologies <eob> to screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how did # we it?
# <eob> our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead starting <eol> with tens # and thousands <eob> of very # expensive # medical <eol> like # traditional AI, <eol> started with a single medical image. <eob>
this image, my team and I xxxxxxx out a very # clever way <eob> to extract billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry and # rendering of the disease on the medical image. <eob>
xx a sense, we xxxxxxxxx one # image into # of data points, <eob> massively reducing the amount # # data <eob> needed xxxxxxxxx <eob>
For our second goal, <eob> xx reduce the use of expensive # medical <eob> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> xx # with # x standard, <eol> # photograph, <eob> acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> x mobile xxx # the # patient. <eob>
Then remember xxxxx <eol> billions information # packets? <eob>
overlaid xxxxx xxxx the medical <eob> xxxxx onto this image, <eob> creating xxxxxxxxx <eol> that we a # composite xxxxxx <eob>
Much to our # surprise, <eol> we xxxx required # -- <eob> I repeat, 50 of <eob> composite xxxxxx to train <eol> our <eob> algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eob> very expensive medical <eol> images, <eob> we can now the AI # an unorthodox way, <eob> using only of these high-resolution, <eob> but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile xxxxxxx <eob> and diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms accept, <eol> in the future xxxx right # now, <eob> some very simple, # xxxxx <eol> photographs from # the patient, <eob> # of xxxxxxxxx imaging technologies. <eol>
I xxxxxxx # that we are poised <eol> to enter an era <eob> xxxxx artificial intelligence <eob> is going to # make an <eol> impact on our future.
And I <eob> think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, <eol> which is application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue thinking <eob> unorthodox artificial intelligence <eob> which # can accept small amounts of data <eob> xxx # some <eob> the most <eol> problems xxxxxx us today, <eob> especially # in health care. <eob>
xxxxx you very <eob>
(Applause) <eol>
What # if # you could <eob> take # a or vaccine <eob> and, just like # getting # over a xxxxx you could # heal your wounds # faster? <eob>
Today, if we have <eol> an operation or xx accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for # weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and # side effects <eol> of our inability xx regenerate <eob> or regrow # healthy, uninjured <eob>
I work to create materials that instruct our immune to give <eol> the signals to grow tissues.
Just <eol> like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to xxxxx disease, <eob> could instead instruct <eol> xxx immune system <eob> to build # tissues <eol> and more quickly xxxx # wounds. <eol>
Now, body xxxxx out # of xxxxxxx <eol> might seem like magic, <eob> but there are # several organisms <eol> that can # achieve this <eob>
Some xxx # regrow their the humble salamander can # completely regenerate their # arm, <eol> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after <eob> losing more than half <eob> of its # original mass. <eob>
To make this magic <eol> a # bit closer to reality, I'm xxx xxx body <eol> can heal wounds and xxxxx tissue <eob> instructions <eob> from the xxxxxxx <eob>
From # a <eob> xxxxxx on xxxx knee <eol> that sinus <eob> our immune system defends <eol> our body from xxxxxxx <eob>
I'm an immunologist, # by using I know about xxx xxxxxx defense system, I # to <eol> identify key xxxxxxx <eob> our fight # xx build # back <eol> our cuts # and bruises. <eob>
When looking <eol> at <eob> materials <eol> that are currently being <eob> tested xxx their abilities to help regrow muscle, our team noticed that treating <eol> an injured muscle with # materials, <eob> there was a number of immune cells in # that material <eob> and the surrounding # <eob> muscle.
So this case, <eob> xxxxxxx of the xxxxxx cells # rushing off <eol> towards # infection xx # xxxxxxxxx <eob> they're <eob> rushing toward xxxxxxx <eol>
I discovered <eol> a # specific <eol> type of # cell, <eol> helper T # cell, <eol> xxx present inside <eob> that material that I implanted <eol> and absolutely critical for wound # healing. <eob>
Now, just # like when you were a kid <eob> you'd break pencil <eob> and try and tape it together again, <eob> can xxxxx <eob> but it not be in the most # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> and <eob> we'll get x scar. <eob>
So # xx we # don't these helper cells, <eob> instead of healthy muscle, <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of xxx and # if fat in our muscle, <eol> xx isn't as strong. <eob>
using our <eol> immune system, <eob> our body could grow # xxxx <eol> without these scars <eob> xxx look like what it <eol> before we were even injured.
I'm to create materials <eob> that give us the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know xxxx any # time <eol> x material is implanted in our body, <eol> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eob>
This # ranges from pacemakers <eob> insulin # pumps to materials <eob> that engineers using <eol> to and build <eob> new tissue. <eol>
So when I place # that or scaffold, in xxx body, <eob> the xxxxxx system creates a small environment # xx cells and # xxxxxxxx <eob> that # can change the way <eol> that our stem xxxxx behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather affects xxx activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # xxx binge-watching <eol> an # entire TV show on <eob> # xxxxxx of a <eob> affects the <eol> our stem cells grow # and # develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong # signals, <eob> say the xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> xx get fat cells <eob> instead # of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are xxxx <eol> xx a variety # of different things, <eob> from plastics to <eol> derived materials, of varying thicknesses, <eob> sponges that are more <eol> or less <eob> porous, <eob> gels of <eob> different stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even # xxx materials different signals over time.
So in other words, we # xxx orchestrate <eob> Broadway # show # of cells <eob> by giving them # <eol> the correct <eol> cues # and <eob> props that # can be xxxxxxx # for <eob> xxxxxxxxx # tissues, <eob> just like a producer would change the set <eol> for "Les Mis" versus <eol> xxxxxxx # Shop # of Horrors". <eob>
I'm # combining specific types of signals <eob> xxxx mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help xx regenerate. <eob>
In # the xx could xxx <eol> a scar-proof xxxxxxxxx <eob> x <eob> moldable muscle filler <eol> or <eob> even a <eob> wound-healing <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, we aren't going to wake up <eol> and to heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next Tuesday, # either.
But <eol> # with these advances, <eob> and working # with # our immune system <eob> to help build # tissue and # xxxx # wounds, <eol> we # could begin seeing <eol> products on # the market <eob> that work with our xxxxxx defense system <eob> to help xx <eob> xx able <eob> to xxxx pace with <eob>
you.

So, # as a child, <eob> I used to spend of <eol> my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, <eob> I would dash xxxxxx xxx floor <eob> xxx stick my face in front of <eol> her only # air <eob>
But didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, xxxxxx brief, was <eob> privileged # in our community. <eob>
Growing up, of xxxxxxxxx neighbors <eol> having # to # xxx fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed # normal to me. <eob>
xxxxxx winter, struggling to get warm, <eol> xx neighbors # have # no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their was shut off, <eob> just to <eol> keep their # family <eol> comfortable for xxx more day. <eol>
kinds of dangerous <eob> can root when people are # faced <eol> with xxxxxxxxxx choices. <eol>
In the US, xxxxxxx American spends <eol> three of xxxxx income energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, even xx percent <eob> of their income on energy.
In 2015, this <eol> million # skip # meals <eol> # provide power to their homes.
This is # xxxx energy # a burden. <eol>
But energy are so much # more than just a # <eob>
They present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do you <eob> take your child <eol> to her flu medicine, <eob> do you feed her? <eob>
Or do xxx keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible xxxxxxx <eob> xxx nearly every <eob> month, <eob> seven million # people choose <eol> between <eob> medicine and energy. <eob>
This xxxxxxx x # much # xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxxxx <eob>
Families # high energy burdens <eol> disproportionately people of color, who spend more per square foot <eol> than # their counterparts. <eob>
But also xxxxxxx <eol> and even xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> who xxxx into the mass xx 37 # million people a year <eob> who xxx xxxxxx to afford <eob> for basic needs. <eol>
As a those with <eol> high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood # # conditions like heart disease # asthma. <eol>
Look -- given our xxxxxxx to Mars <eol> and our pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have <eol> # the <eob> tools to address <eob> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eol>
Cost of # <eob> insulation, <eob> microgrids and smart home technology are # all decreasing. <eob>
However, even xx xx # approach cost parity, <eob> the majority xx those own solar <eol> earn much more than the average # American. <eob>
xxxx is why, xxxx I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit # RETI. <eob>
Our xxxxxxx to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with # communities, <eob> utilities xxx agencies alike <eob> provide equitable access <eol> to # clean energy, <eob> energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology. <eob>
But xxxxxxx no one way to solve this. <eob>
believe in the power <eol> of local xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> xx relationships. <eob>
we xxxxxxx directly <eol> with the xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host # workshops <eol> and events for to learn # about energy # <eob> poverty, <eob> and how making # even # small <eol> updates to their # homes <eob> like insulation for windows <eob> and water heaters <eob> can xx a long # way # to maximize # efficiency. <eol>
We're # connecting neighborhoods <eol> to community solar <eol> and spearheading xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> home research <eob> and # xxxxxxxx <eob> xx help xxxxxxxx bring down <eol> their energy # bills.
We're # even <eol> with officials, advocating # for # equitable <eob> pricing, <eol> because to see this vision of energy equity and resilience succeed, <eol> we have to work together sustainably. <eol>
Now, # the US spends <eol> over three # billion a year <eob> energy xxxx assistance. <eob>
And these programs xx help <eol> millions of people, <eob> but xxxxxxx xxxx to help <eol> a fraction of xxxxx need. <eob>
fact, there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx affordability gap, <eob> so # xxxxx is not sustainable.
by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial # access <eol> to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and # affordable.
At scale, xxxxxxxxx technology, <eol> clean xxxxxxxxxx and energy efficiency <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
And # for xxxx xxxx energy # burdens, <eob> it can help them xxxxxxx <eob> 20 percent their income # xx <eob> 20 percent of # person's # income who's to make ends meet. <eol>
This is life-changing. <eob>
This is an # opportunity <eol> for xxxxxxxx to # use their energy # xxxxxxx <eob> to # sponsor their xxxxxxx <eob>
I think xxxx to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eob> impossible choices <eol> that they had # to make <eol> xxx xxx effect # it had <eol> xx our whole community.
But this is not just about xxxxx <eob>
There are millions nationwide having <eol> to make the same impossible today. <eob>
xxx I # know high # burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to overcome, <eol> but through # <eol> with communities and technology, <eob> we xxxx paths xx <eob> xxxxxxxx them. <eob>
And <eob> when we do, <eob> we will <eob> all be # more resilient. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>

Have you xxxx watched <eob> a of birds work # <eob> together?
Thousands of animals, <eob> in perfect # synchrony: <eob> xxxxx it fascinating? <eol>
What I find remarkable is that birds <eol> would xxx be <eol> able xx do # <eol> if they all <eob> xxxxx # have <eob> to follow <eob> one leader. <eol>
Their reaction # speed <eol> would simply be too # low. <eob>
Instead, <eob> scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned <eob> a few # rules, <eob> allowing every # bird <eob> to <eob> # make autonomous # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx still flying in perfect synchrony. <eob>
alignment enables their <eob> and # their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, # what does this have to do <eol> with one of xxx <eob>
Well, it's # one xxx of <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx what <eol> I xxxxxxx <eol> # to the most important xxxxxx <eob> is # needed in ways of <eob> working today. <eob>
The xx getting faster <eol> and more <eob> so <eob> xx need x new xxx of working, <eob> way that creates xxxxxxxxx around xxxxxxxx that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and that truly # empowers people <eol> to make <eob> decisions faster. <eob>
But the xxxxxxxx is: In order to get there, <eol> what are we willing # xx give <eol>
A few # years ago, # I # was # working with a <eob> that to embark # a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be # simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more # relevant. <eob>
sure how many you <eol> xxxx seen # a # bank from the <eob> so let me try # to illustrate <eol> what <eob> traditional banks look xxxxx <eol>
xxx see # lots of people # in suits <eob> taking <eol> elevators xx go <eob> to their department, <eob> marketers sitting xxxx # marketers, <eol> engineers with # engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings with # 20 people <eob> nothing # gets # decided. <eol>
Great ideas? They up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
there are endless handovers <eol> departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever. <eob>
So xxxx bank knew that # in xxxxx to transform, <eob> they would to # improve <eob> their time # <eol> to market <eob> by drastically changing <eob> their <eol> # working xx well. <eol>
But how? <eob>
get some we decided <eol> to # go and <eol> have a look xxxxxxxxx <eob> that xxxx to be innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how xx were walking the halls at one # these # <eob> December 2014, <eol> a <eob> xxxxxxxxxx consultant <eol> and a team of <eob> bankers.
We felt # like # strangers # in a strange land, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx by beanbags and hoodies <eob> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we xxxxxx <eol> xxxx is your <eob> # organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an xxx # <eob> chart. <eol>
But xxxxxxxx they xxxx <eol> strange # drawings <eob> with funny xxxxx # like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and # xxxxxxxx to explain how # they # were organized. <eob>
So then xx # to # translate <eol> that to our own world. <eob>
We asked, xxxx many people are for you?" <eob> "It
"Who do you to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on # your priorities?" <eob> "It <eol>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for xxxx we thought <eob> were # of basic principles <eob> <eob> and their was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, the course of that <eob> we gained better <eol> # their model.
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like <eob>
They had product people <eol> and IT engineers in xxx same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently xx others in the company. <eob>
# not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the <eol> needed <eol> xxxxx there in the team. <eol>
Now, at the end of # <eob> that <eol> had a <eol> session <eob> to reflect # on what we had learned. <eob>
And we had started to like # their model, <eol> so we were thinking of how to apply some # of these ideas # to x <eol>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> guy who xxx xxx said a word all day, <eol> he xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see you our model. <eob>
But I have one question # xxx you: <eob> What are you willing to give up?" <eob> What were we willing to give xxx <eob>
did # not <eob> have an <eob> answer immediately, <eol> but we knew # he <eob> xxx right. <eol>
Change # is not # only about <eol> embracing the new; <eol> about giving up <eob> on some of the old <eob> well. <eob>
Now, over # the past <eob> five years, <eob> have xxxxxx with companies <eol> xxx over the world <eob> to xxxxxx their # ways of working.
And xxxxxxxx # xxxxx company <eol> has their skeptics <eob> about why this is xxx going # work for # them.
"Our product is more complex," <eob> or # <eob> "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't # xxxx <eol> in our industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx and also for xxx other companies <eob> that I xxxx worked with <eol> change xxx <eob>
a year, we completely <eol> blew up # the old silos <eol> between marketing, <eol> product, channels and IT. <eol>
Three # thousand employees xxxx reorganized <eol> xxxx 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So <eob> of xxxxxxx people <eol> xxxxxxx xxxx # with product people xxx xxxxxxxxx with engineers, <eol> x person and an <eol> engineer were now members # of the same team.
You # could be x member of a team <eol> responsible # for account opening <eob> or xxx the mobile # banking app, <eob>
At the xxxxxxx <eob> date <eol> of that new organization, <eob> some # people shaking xxxxx <eol> for the very first time, <eol> only xx find out that # they had # been sitting two minutes # xxxx from other <eob> but they were # sending each other emails <eol> and status reports for xxx last 10 years. <eob>
You hear someone # saying, <eob> "Ah, so xxxxxx xxx <eol> guy xxxx I <eol> was <eob> always chasing for answers". <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee <eol> together # xxxxx day. <eol>
If the product <eol> guy has # an idea, <eol> he can just raise # it <eob> get input from the engineer <eol> who # is sitting right # next xx him. <eob>
They can to # test with # customers immediately -- <eob> no # no PowerPoints, <eob> no red # tape, <eob> just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, # getting there is not easy. <eob>
as it <eob> xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" exactly the right # question to ask.
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> we <eol> want <eol> the team to decide. <eob>
But to # do <eol> so, we need all # the xxxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxx for that decision xx the team. <eob>
And this xxxxxx difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people <eob> xxx # are in different buildings, <eol> different cities # or even <eob> countries today? <eob>
Or should xx xxxxxx in xxxxxx videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency in the way we do # things across <eol> these teams?
We still need some kind xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all changes to structure and # process and procedure -- <eob> they are <eol> xxx <eob> easy.
But xx the end, <eol> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to change <eob> is our own <eob>
Let try xx illustrate. <eob>
If we <eol> want these teams be fast, flexible, creative, # like # mini-start-up, <eob> they # have # to be xxxxxxxxx and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot # have leaders <eol> commanding their xxxxxx what to do, <eob> when to do, how to do. <eob>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But it also means xxxx # each employee <eol> needs to become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal title. <eob>
It's about all of us stepping <eol> to # initiative. <eob>
Now xxxxxxxxxx we also cannot <eob> to have all these # teams running # in xxxxxxxxx # directions, <eob> because that would <eol> xxxxxxxxx lead xx chaos.
So we need alignment # autonomy <eob> at the same xxxxx <eob> just a of birds. <eob>
In xx organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, <eob> xxxx each new # behavior, <eob> there is # giving up xx something xxx as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> that xxxxxxxx in the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx aligned around the overall # purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the <eob> overall -- the what. <eol>
But then # they have to # go <eol> and trust xxxxx <eol> to # make the right decisions on how to get # <eob> there. <eol>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent communication. <eob>
But # you # know how they say <eol> information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for <eob> some # managers, <eob> sharing may # feel if xxxxxx up that source of power.
And it's not just xxxxxxxxx <eol>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and # transparently as well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx teams typically work in short sprints, <eol> and the end # of every <eol> they <eol> # organize # a demo session <eol> to share xxx output <eol> of what they've done, # transparently. <eob>
xxxxx day, <eob> xxxx member of gives an xxxxxx <eol> of what they are working individually. <eol>
Now, <eob> all this transparency can be uncomfortable xxx because suddenly, there is <eol> place to hide anymore.
Everything we do <eol> is <eol> # transparent for # everyone. <eob>
So, alignment xx not <eob> easy, <eob> xxx <eol> autonomy <eol> is not so xxxxxxxx # either. <eob>
One executive at another # company <eol> likes xx explain how he used to xx <eol> a # of <eob>
Now, today, # know how things are going, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx at reports, <eol> he # needs walk down to the team floors to # attend xxx xxxxx sessions.
And instead of xxxxxxx people # <eob> what # to xxx <eob> # # <eol> ways to # help them. <eob>
That # is xxxxxxx change <eob> xxx someone # xxx # xxxx to be <eob> a of # milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # # old world, # this xxxxxxxxx # said, <eol> "I # had the # control. <eob>
xx reality, projects xxxxx run <eob> over time and over budget, anyway. <eob>
Now I have much transparency, <eob> xxx I xxx course-correct <eol> much earlier # if needed". <eol>
xxx middle <eol> need to change as well. <eol>
First # of xxxx the xxxxxxxxx <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> xxxxxxx less # of a xxxx <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx
And in the there was <eob> this idea xx # thinkers and # doers. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx would # xxxx follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead # only <eol> managing other people, <eol> middle managers were expected <eob> to # become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for last 10 xxxxxx you have just been xxxxxxx <eol> # people what to do, <eol> but now you're expected <eol> xx xx things xxxxxxxx again. <eol>
Clearly, xxxx is xxx for xxxxxxxxx <eol> and some great people the <eob>
But the result a xxx <eol> with # less xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
And all # of <eob> # this # hard <eob> xxxxx <eob>
it's worth it.
xxx xxxxxxxxx that I worked with, <eol> they were used <eol> new product features # a xxx # times per year.
Now they every few # weeks, xxx without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eol> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if # you the <eol> xxxxx <eob> of these companies today, <eob> you just # feel a new energy. <eol>
It feels if # you're walking <eol> the halls # of a very large xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, to be fair, these <eob> companies, <eob> xxxx cannot # claim xxxxxxx xxxx
But at <eob> least with this new xxxxxx <eob> they are # much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The is getting faster xxx more so xx <eob> need to reboot our way of working. <eol>
And the hardest part <eol> of # change <eol> is not # in structure <eob> or process <eol> or procedure, <eob> and it's xxxx # not just <eol> senior xxxxxxxxxx taking charge.
Leaders will # be all # <eol> xx the organization <eol> who embrace the change.
We all have <eol> to lead the change. <eob>
So the question # is: <eol> What are you to # give up? <eol>
xxxxx you.

Whether they are in RVs <eob> or traveling through xxxxxxxx <eob> they are in new xxxxxx <eol> every day, week or month. <eob>
As <eob> long as they # can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> care where are. <eob>
Our # on distributed work <eol> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It # was conscious choice from # xxx xxxx beginning. <eob>
Notice I <eob> don't use the word # because sets up # the expectation, <eob> that # some xxxxxx are essential <eol> and some aren't. <eol>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to <eob> describe what <eol> we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> xx # an equal playing field.
I think a <eol> distributed workforce <eob> is # the most effective xxx <eol> to build a <eob>
The key is you have # xx <eob> it consciously. <eob>
xxxx xx WordPress, <eob> many of xxx 20 hires <eol> people I'd xxxxx met in person. <eob>
But collaborated # online, <eol> sometimes # for years. <eob>
I wanted xx continue <eol> xxx one simple reason. <eob>
x believe talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed <eob> throughout <eob> the <eol> world. <eob> But xxxxxxxxxxx is xxxx <eol>
In # Silicon # xxxxxxx <eol> big tech # companies # <eob> from essentially <eol> the xxxx small <eob> # pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eol> can fish # xxxx the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone # who grew up <eol> xx Japan but lives # <eol> in California, <eob> xxx can <eol> # gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to # sleep <eob> wherever they are in the <eob> bring a <eob> different <eol> understanding <eol> of xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and a # different # lived experience. <eob>
At # the base of the # decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's xxxxxx to people autonomy <eol> they do # their work. <eob>
Unless # # in a role <eob> where # specific are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> you can # make your own <eob> schedule. <eob>
Everyone can # have a # corner office, <eol> their <eob> windows, the food they xxxx to eat, <eol> you can choose there's xxxxx <eol> and <eob> when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eol>
You save xxx time <eol> xxxxx spend commuting <eob> xxx put xx into things <eol> that are important to # you. <eob>
A # distributed workforce <eob> is a technology company. <eob>
But people # xxxxx ask me, <eob> "This works # great for y'all, <eob> but xxxx about everyone else?" <eol> If have # office, <eob> you xxx a # few things <eol> to # build <eol> distributed # capability. <eob>
First: # document everything. <eob>
an office, easy to make decisions # the moment, in the kitchen, in <eob>
But if people # work remotely <eob> and some of <eol> are having those conversations <eob> they don't <eob> # have access to, <eob> see these decisions being made <eol> without understanding why. <eob>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eob> and what you were thinking about. <eob>
This to pick up <eol> where you xxxx off. <eob>
xx allows people in # different <eol> time <eob> zones to interact, <eol> it's also great xx think about <eob> as an organization evolves, <eob> xxxxxx and # joining. <eob>
Try to # have # xx much communication as possible online. <eob>
xxxx everything's and xxxxxxx <eol> it allows new people to # catch quickly. <eob>
You also # xxxx to find the right <eob>
There are # so many apps and # services <eol> that help xxxx day-to-day # <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # changed how # you <eob> probably aren't objects xxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # things you access <eol> your computer. <eob>
So # with <eob> tools that enable collaboration, <eob> see what works.
# productive, face-to-face time.
In a traditional # office, <eol> xxxxxx in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out xx the year <eob> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks apart. <eob>
We try to flip that: we come xxxxxxxx <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once x year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the # entire company comes xxxxxxxx # for a xxxxx
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary goal is connecting people. <eob> xx xx xxxx sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on same # <eol> and they have a xxxxxx # connection <eol> with their <eol> colleagues. <eob>
When they work # together <eol> the rest of # the xxxxx <eob> xxxx can bring # together <eob> # understanding and empathy. <eol>
And the final xxxxxxxxx <eob> give people the flexibility to make <eob> their own work environment. <eob>
Every <eob> # person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eob> that <eob> # <eol> towards a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eol> or just to buy coffee, <eob> so they don't <eob> get kicked xxx # of the coffee shop. <eob>
One xxxxx in Seattle <eob> to pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a xxxxxxxxx # fishing pier.
Each joins # xxx company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This they can invest <eol> in getting # the right chair, xxxxxxxx the right desk setup, so can have <eob> the # productive environment xxx them. <eob>
Today, # there are # just a few # companies <eob> that distributed # first.
In a decade or # two, <eol> I that percent companies <eob> that # are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eob> xxx going to function # way. <eol>
will xxxxxx <eob> to distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by xxxxx are. <eob>
xx you think xxxxx <eol> what you're to build next, consider how you can tap <eob> into global talent, give # people xx # live and work <eol> where they # they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eol> it xx that you're creating xxxxxxxxx <eob>
