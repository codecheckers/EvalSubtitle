Our xxxxxx # goal -- we more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # xxxxxx <eob> # xxx # use <eol> xx expensive # medical # technologies <eol> to screen patients. <eob>
So # xx # do it? <eob>
For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxxx <eol> xxxx tens # xxx <eob> of these # xxxx expensive images, <eol> like # AI, <eol> we # started # xxxx # a <eob> xxxxxx # medical <eob> image. <eob>

For xxxxxx # goal, <eob> xx reduce # use expensive xxxxxxx <eol> technologies screen # patients, <eob> we xxxxxxx # with # a # standard, white # photograph, <eob> acquired either from a DSLR camera <eol> or a # xxxxxx # for the patient. <eob>
Then # xxxxx <eol> billions # of information xxxxxxxx <eob>
overlaid those # from <eol> medical # # this image, <eob> creating # <eol> that we call # x # composite image. <eob>
to our surprise, <eol> we # only required # xx -- <eob> I xxxxxxx # 50 <eob> of composite # images # xx # xxxxx our # algorithms to # high efficiencies. <eol>
To # approach, <eob> instead of using 10,000 <eol> expensive <eob> can # train # the AI <eol> an # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxx xxxx # <eob> 50 of <eob> # these high-resolution, <eol> # standard photographs, <eob> acquired # from DSLR <eol> xxx mobile xxxxxxx <eob> diagnosis.

A # years # xxxx I was xxxxxxx with # a # xxxx <eob> that wanted to # <eol> on # xxxxxxx transformation. <eol>
wanted offering to be simpler, <eol> more intuitive, <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, xxx not sure how of xxx <eol> xxxx # a bank the inside, <eob> so let # me # try illustrate <eol> xxxx # xxxx traditional # banks # look # like. <eob>
You see # of # xxxxxx suits <eob> # # to # go their <eob> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers # with xxxx <eob>
You xxx # xxxxxxxx # xx # people <eob> where xxxxxxx gets decided. <eol>

And there # are endless <eol> between # departments. <eob>
xxxxxxxx done # xxx take <eob>
this bank <eol> that in xxxxx # transform, <eob> they # would have to improve <eol> xxxx to # market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> xxxx xx xxxxxxx well. <eob>
But <eob>
xx get some inspiration, we xxxxxxx <eol> go and have # a # at # companies <eob> xxxx # to be # more innovative, <eob> like Netflix, xxxxxxx <eob>
And remember # were xxxxxxx <eob> the halls # one xx # companies <eob> in xxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> a management # <eol> xxx a <eol> xxxx # of bankers. <eob>
xx felt # like xxxxxxxxx # xx a strange xxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # hoodies <eob> xxx # lots of xxxxxx creative employees. <eob>
then asked, <eol> "How xx your xxxxxxx <eob> And we expected an org xxxxxx
But xxxxxxxx xxxx used strange # drawings <eob> with funny like # <eol> and # and <eob> xx explain how # they # were <eob>
So xx tried to translate <eol> to xxx own xxxxxx <eob>
xx <eob> xxxxxx # "How xxxx xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx for # xxxxx <eob> "It depends". <eob>

xx xxxx asking # # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxx of xxx # basic # principles <eob> of <eob> and xxxxxx was, # "It <eob> depends". <eob>
Now, # xxx xxxxxx that <eob> # gained # a xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx # of # model. <eob>
believed in # the <eol> of autonomous xxxxxx <eol>
xxxxx # xxxxx # like mini-start-ups. <eob>

xxx xxx need handovers <eol> # departments. <eol>
They xxx all xxx # xxxxxx <eol> right there xx # xxx xxxxx <eob>
xxxx xx # the of that <eol> # had # x xxxxxxx # xxxxxxx xx # what we xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
And had # to # xxxx their xxxxxx <eob> so xx were already # xx <eol> to apply of # xxxxx <eob> # xxxxx a bank. <eob>
xxx # xxxxx # one # xx the # <eol> a who had not said a all <eob> xx # xxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> "So I see you # # our model. <eob>

But this bank # and <eol> for the # companies <eob> xxxx x have with xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> change # possible. <eob>
Within a year, # we completely <eol> xxxx <eob> up the # # silos <eob> # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> product, # channels # <eob>
Three thousand employees reorganized <eol> into 350 <eob>
So xxxxxxx # xx # people <eol> sitting <eol> # with # <eob> product xxxxxx <eob> and xxxxxxxxx with # engineers, <eob> a xxxxxxx person and an # <eol> were now members # xxx # same team. <eol>

# there is not <eol> # easy. <eob>
# xx turns out, <eob> "What are xxx willing to # xxxx # <eob> the xxxxx xxxxxxxx # ask. <eob>
# xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> multidisciplinary xxxxxx <eob>
