xx when I place xxxxxxxxx <eol> or scaffold, # in the body, <eob> the # xxxxxx # # <eol> xxxxxxx a small environment of cells # and proteins <eob> can # change the # way <eol> that our # stem # cells behave. <eob>
xxxx just <eob> like # xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx our daily activities, <eob> xxxx # run <eob> or # staying # inside binge-watching <eol> an entire xx show on Netflix, <eob> the immune # a xxxxxxxx affects xxx # way that <eol> our # xxxx cells xxx develop. <eob>

Well, xxxx # one way xx what <eob> x to be <eob> the most change xxxx is needed in ways <eob> of working today. <eol>
The world is getting faster <eol> xxx complex, so xx xxxx a new # way # xx working, <eob> way that creates alignment <eol> around # purpose, <eob> xxxx xxxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and <eob> that xxxxx empowers <eol> xx # decisions <eob>
But xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> order <eob> to get there, what are # we willing xx # give # up? <eob>
A few ago, x was with x <eol> xxxx <eob> wanted <eol> to <eol> on x # <eob>
They wanted their to simpler, <eob> more more # relevant. <eol>
Now, xxx not xxx # many of # you have seen x from <eob> the # xxxxxxx <eob> so xx try # to illustrate <eol> what many traditional # banks xxxx <eob> like. <eob>
xxx see # lots xx # people suits <eob> taking <eol> elevators to # go to # <eob> department, <eob> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with etc. <eob>
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people <eob> where gets xxxxxxxx <eob>
ideas? They end # up <eol> xx <eol> PowerPoint parking lots.
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can take xxxxxxxx <eob>
So this <eob> bank knew <eol> xxxx in # # transform, <eob> xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx <eol> their time xx # market <eob> drastically changing <eob> their # # of # # xx well.
But how?
xx # get <eob> some xxxxxxx <eol> xx # xx and # # a look # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to xx more # innovative, <eol> like Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
xxx I remember how # we # <eol> the # halls at # these companies <eob> xx # December 2014, <eob> a management # <eob> consultant <eol> and x # team of bankers. <eol>
xxxx # strangers # a strange # land, <eob> surrounded # xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we # asked, "How xx your company organized?" <eob> And xx expected <eol> xx xxx xx org <eob>
xxx instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx drawings <eol> xxxx # funny xxxxx like # xxxxxxxx <eob> and "chapters" # "tribes" <eob> xx explain how were organized. <eob>
So then # we tried translate xxxx our # own <eob> world. <eob>
We asked, "How many xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx # you?" <eol> # depends". <eob>
# do # report <eob>
"Who xxxxxxx on # priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You xxx # imagine # our <eob>
We # were # asking xxx <eol> some <eol> # the <eob> basic # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> of organizations, <eol> and answer xxxx xxx depends". <eob>
Now, course # of that xxxx <eob> gained # a # better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their <eob>
They in xxx power xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups. <eob>
had # <eol> # people <eol> and # <eob> engineers # in the same team <eol> so they <eob> could # design, # build and test ideas # customers <eob> independently of others xx the company.
xxxx # did xxxx # handovers <eol> # <eob>
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed <eol> right there in the team. <eol>
Now, # at the of that <eob> x # session <eob> # reflect xx <eol> what xx had # learned.
# we xxx # started to # their # model, <eob> so xx were thinking of how <eol> xxxxx some of # these ideas xx a # xxxxx
But then, one # of hosts, <eob> a who said # a # all day, xx suddenly said, xxx you xxx xxxxxx <eol>
But x have one question you: <eob> What xxx willing # to # xxxx up?" <eob> xxxx xx <eob> xxxxxxx to # give up? <eob>
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, <eob> but # we <eob> xxxx he was right. <eob>
# xx not # only <eol> embracing the <eob> it's about up <eol> some of # xxx old <eob> as well. <eob>
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx <eob> # have # with companies <eob> xxxx xxx # xxxxx <eol> to # xxxxxx ways of # working. <eob>
xxxxxxxx <eol> # every company <eol> has their xxx skeptics <eol> about why # <eob> this # is not <eol> going # xx work # for # <eob>
xxxx # product is # more complex," <eob> or "They don't xxxx the legacy # IT like do," <eob> "Regulators # just won't allow this <eol> xx # <eol> our industry". <eob>
But for this # also <eol> xxx # companies <eob> that x xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> was possible. <eob>
x # we completely xxxx # up old silos <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx channels # and <eol> IT. <eol>
Three thousand employees <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
So instead of product xxxxxx <eob> sitting xxxx xxxx product people <eob> and engineers # with engineers, a <eob> product person # xx engineer were members of # same xxxxx
xxx xxxxx # xx <eol> # member of # a team <eol> responsible account # opening <eob> or for the # <eob> mobile banking xxxx etc. <eob>
At xxxxxxx date that # new xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx # people were <eob> shaking # xxxxx <eol> for # xxx very first <eob> only # # find # out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away # <eob> xxxx # each # <eob> but they were sending each # other emails <eol> xxx status # xxx the # last # 10 # years. <eob>
# would xxxx someone saying, <eob> # xx you're the guy that <eol> was for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
now, # they're # <eob> xxxxxx <eol> together # every <eol>
If the product # # an # xxxxx he # xxxx xxxxx it <eob> to # get input from # the engineer <eol> who # xxxxxxx xxxx <eol>
can <eol> decide to # test <eol> with <eob> xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> no # xx PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> just # getting xxxxx done. <eob>
# getting # <eol> is xxx easy. <eob>
And as it turns out, <eob> "What # you # willing # to # xxxx # up?" <eob> is exactly the right <eol> question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous # <eol> requires # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions going <eol> up and down the organization, <eol> we want # xxxx # # decide.
But # to xx so, xxxx all the skills <eol> xxx expertise # for that decision <eob> in <eol>
# <eob> this brings trade-offs. <eol>
# we physically xxx xxxxxx <eob> who are in different buildings, <eob> xxxxxxxxx cities xx even <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eol>
Or # xx <eol> in # better videoconferencing? <eob>
xxx do we # xxxxxx in # the way we do xxxxxx these teams? <eob>
We xxxxx xxxx # <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx matrix. <eob>
# xxx # these xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> and process # and xx <eob> they # not xxxxx <eob>
But the xxxx <eob> I xxxxx # that # <eol> # most <eol> difficult # xx # change <eol> is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx me try <eol>
xxxx # these teams # be fast, flexible, # <eol> # x # <eob> they xxxx to # be empowered xxx autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx <eob> leaders <eol> commanding # their # people what to # xxx <eob> when to do, how # xx
No # micromanagers. <eob>
But it means that each employee <eol> xxxxx # xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx # formal xxxxxx <eol>
xxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx # xx <eol> xx xxxx initiative. <eob>
# xxxxxxxxxx xx # xxxx cannot afford xxxx all # <eob> these teams <eol> in xxxxxxxxx directions, xxxxxxx xxxx would <eol> certainly # lead to <eol> chaos. <eol>
we # and xxxxxxxx <eob> at # same xxxxx <eob> just # xxxx flock # of birds. <eob>
an organizational # setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, xxx with xxxx behavior, <eob> there is up on # old well. <eob>
Leaders # <eob> xxxx to make sure <eol> xxxx everyone in the organization <eob> is xxxxxxx # around the purpose xx the # why -- <eob> the overall # priorities -- xxx # xxxxx
then # have to let # go <eol> and <eob> # <eob> xxxx the right decisions <eol> # how # to get <eob> there. <eob>
Now, creating xxxxxxxxx requires open # xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication.
But you know # how they # xxx that # information # source # of power? <eob>
xxxxx for some # managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if # giving # up that xxxxxx of # power. <eob>
And it's just # xxxxxxxxx <eol>
teams <eol> xxxxxx and # xx # well. <eol>
xx xxx # teams <eol> typically # xxxx xxxxx <eol> and xx # end of <eob> # every sprint, <eol> they organize # a xxxx # <eob> to share the <eol> of what done, # transparently. <eob>
And # day, <eob> each # member of # # xxxx gives an <eob> of they are xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eol> can be uncomfortable # for # people, <eob> because # suddenly, there <eol> xx xxxxx to hide # anymore. <eol>
Everything we <eol> xxx everyone. <eol>
So, is xxx # <eob> and # <eol> is not # # either. <eob>
One # executive # <eob> likes # xx how xx xxxx to be <eob> a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, today, to # xxxx how # are <eol> # going, <eob> instead # of xxxxxxx at status # reports, <eob> he # needs to walk # # # # xxxx floors one of # their sessions.
instead of # people xxxx to do, <eol> he looks <eob> # ways to # help # them. <eob>
xxxx is change <eob> for # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eol> # xxxxxx of <eob> milestone-tracking. <eol>
But in # the old <eob> world, xxxx executive xxxxx <eob> "I only the xxxxxxxx control.
In reality, <eob> projects would # run <eol> over time over anyway. <eob>
Now I have much <eol> more transparency, <eob> and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx earlier xxxxxxxx <eol>
And middle xxxxxxxx <eol> need to change as well. <eob>
First of all, without the <eol> PowerPoint, <eob> there's # less # of # a need <eol> for middle managers. <eob>
And # in xxx # there was <eob> # idea of and doers.
# would # xxxx <eob> follow orders. <eol>
But # # instead of xxxx <eob> other <eol> middle <eol> managers # expected <eol> to become # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # xxx the last xx <eob> you xxxx been # telling <eol> other xxxxxx # what xx <eob> but xxxxxx expected <eol> # xx things yourself <eob>
xxxxxxxx # this model # is xxx xxx everyone, <eob> xxx # <eol> xxxx great # people leave # the <eob>
xxx xxx result # a # culture <eol> xxxx less <eob> # <eob>
xxx of xxxx # xxxx work. <eob>
But # it.
The companies that # x worked with, <eob> they # were used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx features # few # times # year.
Now xxxx # every few weeks, <eob> and # xxx handovers <eol> # # red tape, <eob> # <eob> whole # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> more xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx # finally, xxxx # <eol> these # companies xxxxxx <eob> just <eob> a # new <eob>
