Welcome to the <eol> world # of cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx of harassment women <eol> face xx <eob> # Pakistan is <eol> very <eob> and leads to # sometimes <eob> deadly
This kind of harassment keeps women <eob> accessing the internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's x # form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx <eol> country <eol> in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eob> mobile technologies, <eol> and 15 percent penetration. <eob>
And this number # doesn't seem # # go down with xxx rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan also the birthplace <eol> of the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eob>
But just xxx of Pakistan. <eob>
Another # aspect is where the <eol> twisted xxxxxxx of <eob> is linked to women # and their # xxxxxxx where men are to disrespect women <eol> and even them xxxxxxxxx <eol> in the name of so-called "family <eob> where # women are left # die right # outside their houses for # speaking to a man on <eol> a xxxxxx <eob> in # xxx name <eob> of "family honor". <eol>
# me <eob> say very clearly: <eob> it's not honor; <eob> a # murder. <eob>
I come from a xxxx # small village <eol> xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eob> where women xxx not xxxxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
elders of xx family didn't allow # xxxxx women <eob> to xxxxxx their higher # education <eol> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx # the other <eol> male <eob> guardians of <eol> my family, <eob> my father was # who really supported # my # <eob>
To <eob> get law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, # really difficult, and [there <eob> frowns of disapproval. <eol>
xxx the end, I xxxx <eol> it's either # me or xxxxx <eob> and chose myself. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx <eob> family's traditions <eol> and expectations a <eob> woman wouldn't allow me to <eob> a mobile <eol> phone until married. <eob>
And even when I was married, <eob> this became <eob> a tool <eol> for my own surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted this idea <eol> of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he # really didn't approve of <eob> this <eob> and # threw me of xxx house, <eob> xxxxx my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time <eol> when I xxxxx asked <eol> myself,
Why are # women not to <eol> enjoy xxx xxxx equal rights enshrined # in our # Constitution? <eob>
While # <eob> xxx xxxxxx # <eob> that a woman has xxx same # xxxxx xxxxxx <eob> the # information, <eob> why <eob> is it # always men xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eob> who # are <eob> xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, <eob> effectively making # the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to # <eol> take a step, instead keep questioning # patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital # Rights <eol> Foundation # in # 2012 <eol> to address all xxx issues <eol> xxx women's <eob> experiences in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment.
From lobbying for xxxx and <eol> safe # internet convincing young women <eob> that access <eol> # <eob> to the safe internet <eol> is fundamental, basic, # human right, <eob> I'm trying # to play part <eob> xx igniting spark <eol> to address the questions <eol> that have # all these years. <eob>
With # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to offer <eob> a solution to this menace, <eob> I <eol> started Pakistan's xxx the region's first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December # 2016 -- <eob> <eol>
to support xxx # xxxxx <eol> who # xx know who to xxxx to <eob> when # they face serious threats online. <eol>
I of the women # who do xxx have <eol> the necessary <eob> to deal the mental trauma <eol> # feel unsafe <eol> in <eob> online # <eob> xxxx go xxxxx their xxxxx activities, <eob> thinking xxxx there # <eol> # rape # threat in # their in-box. <eol>
Safe # access to xxx internet <eol> is xx access to knowledge, <eob> and is freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's <eol> rights, xxx fighting xxx equality.

(Applause) <eob>
xx a critical moment. <eol>
Our leaders, <eob> some # of <eol> our great institutions <eob> xxx failing us. <eob>
xxxx <eob>
xx cases, it's because they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eob> xxx often, they've xxxxx us to the xxxxx objectives. <eob>
is unacceptable. <eob>
This has # xx stop. <eob>
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we going <eol> to xxxxxx the right <eol>
xxx going to # be easy. <eob>
For # years, # I've worked with talented # teams <eob> and they've chosen <eob> xxx right objectives xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many have succeeded, others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to # share with you <eob> what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- <eol> xxxxxx what's how and # they xxx meaningful # audacious goals, <eob> the <eob> xxxxx # goals xxx the right # reasons. <eol>
Let's # go # back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, # is # me. <eob>
I've got a to xxxxxx <eol> I'm x computer <eol> I've got long hair, <eol> I'm under # xxxx Grove, <eol> been called the manager <eob> of his # or any xxxxx era. <eob>
Andy was a leader <eol> xxx also a # teacher, <eol> and he # # to me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know.
Execution is <eol> xxxx matters the <eob>
And so # x # xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off <eol> the xxxxxxx doesn't # it? <eob>
And it's all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eob>
So # here's # # classic <eol> video from 1970s <eol> xx professor Andy <eol> xxxxxx
(Video) # <eol> Andy Grove: # The xxx key # phrases <eol> xx the management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The # <eob> key results have to measured, <eob> the end you can look and without xxx argument say, <eob> "Did I do or did I not do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. # Simple.
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eob> or OKRs, <eol> are <eob> a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system <eob> and they work for organizations, <eol> they work xxx teams, <eol> they even work for individuals. <eob>
xxx # are <eob> you want to have accomplished.
The key are # how <eol> I'm going to get # xxxx # done. <eob>
Objectives. Key <eob>
What and # how. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eob> many xx us are setting # goals wrong, xxx most us are # not setting goals xx xxxx
lot of organizations <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them.
They ship their xxxxxx <eol> they introduce their # products, <eol> they make xxxxx numbers, but # they lack a sense xx <eol> to <eol> inspire <eol> their teams. <eob>
how do # you set these goals the right <eob>
First, # you must answer <eol> xxx "Why?" <eol> Why? <eol>
Because transformational teams <eob> combine their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion and to their purpose, <eob> xxx they develop # a clear and xxxxxxxxxx sense xx why. <eob>
I <eol> to you a story.
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eob>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eob>
She runs a <eob> company called Nuna. <eob>
Nuna <eol> is a health care company. <eob>
And when xxx founded, <eob> they used data # to serve the # health <eol> lots xx workers at large
And two years <eol> into the life, <eob> the # federal <eob> government <eol> issued a <eob> to build the first # ever <eol> cloud database
Now, xxxxxx # remember <eol> that is that # program <eob> that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children <eob> xxx xxxxxx with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at # the xxxx # xxx # just # xx <eob> xxx database <eol> had to be built # xx xxx year, <eob> and they xxx xxxxx set commitments <eol> they had to honor, xxx frankly, they <eob> weren't # going # xx make <eob> very much money on the <eol>
This # was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini # seized xxx <eob>
jumped # at # opportunity. xxx did not flinch. <eol>
xxxx
Well, <eob> xxxx a # xxxxxxxx why. <eob>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx <eol> Kimong has autism. <eob>
And # when he <eob> xxx seven, <eob> xx had xxx xxx seizure at Disneyland. <eol>
# xxxx ground. <eob> He <eob>
Jini's are xxxxxx immigrants. <eol>
They came to # the xxxxxxx <eob> with # resources <eob> speaking <eol> little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it up # xx # xxxx <eol> to <eob> enroll family # in Medicaid. <eol>
was nine xxxxx xxxx <eob>
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became <eol> her <eob> company, <eob> xxx that xxxxxxx <eol> bid on, won <eol> xxx delivered on that # contract. <eol>
Here's Jini # to tell # you xxxx <eob>
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eol> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today it provides for <eol> and millions of # others. <eol>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid.
Every # row of is a <eol> life <eol> whose story # <eol> deserves to be told with dignity. <eol>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us that compelling why can the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, that's what <eol> xx want to have accomplished.
objectives are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, they are <eol> xxx they're a # kind of vaccine <eol> xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You # think a rockstar <eol> be an unlikely xxxx <eol> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eob> but for <eob> years, Bono # <eob> used xxxx <eob> to # <eob> xxxx # a global war xxxxxxx poverty and disease, <eol> and xxx organization <eol> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, <eob> objectives. <eob>
The # first is xxxx # <eol> relief <eob> for the # poorest countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is universal <eol> access <eob> to drugs. <eob>
Now, why these good objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back xx # our # checklist.
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's # to Bono. <eob>
(Video) Bono: # So you're passionate? <eob>
How
# xxxxxxx does passion <eob> xxxx xxx # to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a perfect # <eol> rhyme with the head, <eob> then # passion means <eob>
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, the <eol> chemistry # contained # inside # xxx <eob>
gives # us # for risk, for trust, <eob> where failing not <eob> a fireable
And when <eob> xxx have that sort # structure xxx environment and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eol>
JD: love <eob>
OKRs cultivate # the <eob> and magic # <eol> is right # the corner. <eob>
xxxx is perfect. <eob>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, <eob> with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn our # attention the hows. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx the xxxx # are the # key results. <eob> That's xxx # we meet # our <eol>
And good <eob> are xxxxxxxx <eob> and time-bound. <eol>
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx # realistic. <eol>
xxxxxxx and they're verifiable. <eob>
# xxx xxxx key <eob> # results. <eob>
In xxxxx introduced OKRs <eol> to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and Sergey. <eol>
xxxx they are, <eol> # years old # garage. <eob>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eob>
he really xxxx was, <eob> "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eol> so we'll give it a go". (Laughter)
And I took xxxx as <eol> a kind of endorsement.
But quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has written <eob> down <eol> # objectives and xxx key <eol>
They've # graded them, <eol> and <eob> # they've xxxxxxxxx them for everyone to <eol> xxxx <eob>
these xxx xxxx <eob> for bonuses # or for promotions.
xxxxxxx # set # aside. <eob>
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eob> and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly stretch <eol> goals. <eob>
In <eob> 2008, # a <eol> Googler, Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective xxxxx was to # build <eob> the next client platform <eob> the future of web applications -- <eol> in other xxxxx the browser. <eob>
# very thoughtful <eol> how # he <eol> chose his # key # results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
could xx clicks # or engagement. <eob>
No. He said: numbers of <eob> users # are # going to decide <eol> Chrome a # great or not.
So he had this # one <eob> three-year-long # objective: <eob> build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx
And then every # year <eol> he xxxxx to the xxxx # key # results, <eol> of users, he upped the # ante. <eob>
In the first year, his # xxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> and he missed it. <eob>
He xxx less than 10. <eob>
Second year, he raised <eol> the bar # to # million.
He got to 37 million users. <eol>
Somewhat <eol>
In the xxxxx # year, <eob> he the ante once # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx # an <eol> marketing campaign, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> improved # the <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eob>
xxx # 111 million xxxxxx
xxx <eob> I like story, <eob> not so # xxx the # xxxxx ending, <eob> it shows xxxxxxx <eol> carefully choosing the objective <eol> and then xxxxxxxx <eob> to it <eob> year # after xxxx after <eob>
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eob>
Now, I think of # OKRs as vessels <eol> xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eol> and xxxx of our # ambitions.
What really matters xx # the why <eol> that we xxxx into those # vessels.
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eob>
They're not # going to be for a strong culture <eob> or # for stronger leadership, # xxxx those fundamentals are # # place, <eob> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eob>
I # to think <eol> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment.
Do you # # right <eol>
xxxx xxxx xx write down xxxx values, <eob> your objectives # your key results. <eob>
Do it xxxxxx <eob>
If you'd some feedback # them, <eol> you can send # to # me. <eob>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If think xx world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a <eob> # Nuna, xx of Google, they're # remarkable: <eob> ubiquitous computing, <eol> affordable xxxxxx <eol> high-quality for <eob> ending global poverty, <eol> access # to all xxx # information. <eol>
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eol> xx powered today by OKRs.
Now, I've been xxxxxx <eol> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eol> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eol> xxx I want you <eol> to join # <eob> me in this movement. <eob>
Let's fight for what it is <eob> that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because we can # take xxxx beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx
We can take them to # families, <eol> to our schools, <eol> even to our governments.
those governments accountable.
We can transform # those informations. <eol>
We can back on the track if we <eol> can and # do measure what really xxxxxxxx <eob>
# you. <eol>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
What # history?
It is # something written by the winners.
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eob> should be # focused <eol> on xxxxxxx <eol> like # Lenin # or <eob>
xx <eob> a result, people <eol> xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # mine, Russia, look xx history as something <eol> xxxx was predetermined or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and common people could not <eob> influence it in xxx way. <eob>
Many <eob> Russians today do <eob> xxx believe that Russia could been will a truly # democratic xxxxxxx <eob> # this is due # to the way <eob> history has been framed <eob> xxx # Russia. <eol>
And this is true. <eol>
To prove # it, <eol> # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx <eob> to xxx year <eob> the xxxx of the Russian <eob> # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if internet <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx <eol> x social network xxx dead # people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My <eol> team and x created # our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded <eol> all possible # real diaries and letters <eol> written by more than 3,000 <eob> xxxxxx <eob> 100 ago. <eol>
So any user of <eob> our website or can # follow a xxxx feed <eol> for each day 1917 <eob> xxx read <eob> what people <eob> xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, <eol> xxxxx xx # Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eol> being xxxxxx like you and me, xxx demigods, # we see that history # <eol> of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxxxxxx # was a for many Russians, <eob> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx <eob> has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas of freedom and democracy <eob> could # never have prevailed, <eob> just # because <eol> xxxxxxxxx was xxx our destiny. <eob>
xxx if we # take broader it's not that black and white. <eob>
Yes, # xxxx # led to <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But this project, we # xxx that Russia <eol> have # had a # different history <eob> and a xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the <eol> posts xxxx # <eob> you learn that Russia <eol> xxx <eob> the <eob> # first # country # in the <eob> to abolish the death penalty, or xxx of the xxxxx # ones <eob> to grant women # voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced # history <eob> can help a better because history is just a rehearsal what's happening xxxxx now. <eol>
We xx need new telling <eol> history, <eob> and xxxxx xxx example, <eob> we started # a new online # project that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> xxx that # is # an online series <eob> that # you an impression <eol> of year, a # year by social <eob> change <eol> that, many ways, <eol> the # world as we xxxx it
But we # making that history xxxxx <eob> by xxxx if xxx the main <eol> could xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we see xxxx a lot of # individuals were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting for the values, <eol> no if they lived <eob> in US or in USSR <eol> or xx France or xx # China or in <eob> Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By <eob> xxxxxxxx history <eob> in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, through # media, <eob> we show that people <eob> in # <eol> are not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eob>
gives any user a possibility <eob> xx reclaiming
Ordinary people matter.
They have an <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxxxx # scientists, <eol> philosophers # xxxxxxx

Computer algorithms today <eol> xxx <eob> performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> with accuracies, <eob> a xxxxxxx using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

AI # xx poised to make an incredible impact <eob> on xxx lives in the future. <eob>
Today, however, <eol> we still face xxxxxxx challenges <eob> in detecting and <eob> several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eol>
of patients every xxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> due to <eol> xxxxx and # oral cancer. <eob>
best # way to # help these patients is to # perform early # detection <eob> and diagnoses of these # diseases.
So how do # we detect today, <eol> and can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx help? <eob>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of these diseases, <eob> xx expert physician first <eob> expensive medical imaging # technologies <eob> xxxx as imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, <eob> xxxxxxx expert physician then diagnoses <eol> # talks <eob> xx # the <eob> patient. <eob>
As you # <eob> xxx see, this is a very resource-intensive process, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # # expert <eob> # physicians, expensive imaging technologies, <eob> xxx # is not # considered practical <eob> the developing xxxxxx
And in fact, in many <eol> industrialized # nations, xx <eol>
So, can we solve # this # problem <eob> using artificial intelligence? <eob>
Today, x xxxx to # xxx traditional <eol> artificial intelligence # architectures to <eol> solve this problem, <eob> I would require <eob> 10,000 -- repeat, on an order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eol> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After xxxxx I would then # go <eob> an expert <eob> would # then analyze <eol> those images for # me. <eob>
And # using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> I can # a # standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning <eol> to # <eob> provide # xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Similar to the <eob> first approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> approaches <eob> suffer from the same # problem. <eol>
xxxxx # amounts <eob> xx xxxxx # expert <eob> # <eob> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence architectures <eol> to solve these important <eob> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly what xx group # at MIT Media xxxxx <eob>
We variety <eol> xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx solve <eol> xxxx xx the most important <eol> challenges facing us # <eob> in medical imaging and # clinical trials. <eob>
In the # example I shared <eol> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required to train artificial intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eob> we wanted xx # reduce of medical imaging technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eol>
So how did we do it? <eob>
our first goal, <eob> xx starting xxxx # tens and thousands these very expensive medical images, <eol> xxxx traditional we started xxxx single # xxxxxx <eob>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and I <eob> figured out a very clever # <eol> way <eob> to extract # billions <eol> xx information packets. <eol>
These information xxxxxxx <eob> colors, pixels, geometry <eob> and rendering # of xxxxxxx <eol> on the # medical image. <eob>
In a # we # one image xxxx # <eob> billions xx training data points, <eol> massively reducing xx data needed for
xxx our goal, <eol> to # the # use of # expensive medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # <eob> screen xxxxxxxxx we started with a standard, <eol> white light acquired either # from a # camera <eol> or x mobile # phone, xxx <eob> the <eob> patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions # of information # packets? <eob>
xx overlaid <eob> xxxxx from <eol> xxxxxxx image onto # this image, <eob> something that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much to xxx surprise, <eol> we xxxx required -- <eob> I only 50 -- <eob> these images # our algorithms # xxxx # efficiencies.
To # <eob> summarize our approach, <eol> instead of using # <eol> very medical # images, <eob> we now train <eol> the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> using 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard # <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> and # xxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and provide xxxxxxxxxx
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> our algorithms # can accept, in the future and even right now, some very simple, <eol> # white light xxxxxxxxxxx from the <eob> instead # of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I believe that # xx # <eob> to enter xx # era <eob> where artificial intelligence <eob> is <eol> going to make <eol> impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think that thinking <eob> xxxxx traditional AI, <eol> which is data-rich xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eol> about # unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx which can accept xxxxxxx of data <eob> and <eol> xxxxx some <eob> xx the most xxxxxxxxx <eol> problems facing # us today, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in health care.

Now, just like when you were a kid and break your xxxxxx <eob> xxx try xxx tape <eol> it together again, <eob> we can heal, but it not be <eol> in xxxx # functional way, <eob> # we'll get a <eob>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, <eob> xxx muscle <eol> fat cells inside <eob> of it, <eob> and # if there's # fat in # our muscle, <eob> isn't as <eob>
Now, using xxx # immune xxxxxxx <eob> xxx body # grow back <eol> without # scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even # <eob>
I'm working to create <eob> that give xx # <eol> the signals <eol> to new tissue by # the immune response.
We know that # time <eob> a # material is xxxxxxxxx # body, <eob> the immune # xxxxxxx # xx # it. <eob>
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # xxxxx new <eol>
when I place material, <eol> scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune system # creates <eob> small # environment of cells and proteins <eob> xxxx can change xxx # way <eol> that # our stem cells behave.
Now, just like the weather <eol> our xxxxx # activities, <eob> like going for a run <eol> or inside binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, <eol> the immune environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that our # stem cells # xxxx # and # develop.
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eob> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eob> we get xxx cells instead of muscle.
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eol> of a variety of <eob> different # plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, <eob> that are more or less porous, <eob> gels different stiffnesses.
And researchers <eob> can even xxxx materials <eob> release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So <eol> # in <eol> xxxxxx # orchestrate <eob> xxxxxxxx show cells <eob> xx # giving them the correct stage, cues and props # can # be changed # for different tissues, <eol> just # like a producer xxxxx change <eob> the set <eob> for # "Les # Mis" versus <eol> # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
xxx combining specific # of signals that xxxxx our body to injury to help us # <eol> regenerate. <eob>
the xxxxxxx we could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx band-aid, <eol> a moldable filler <eol> even a wound-healing vaccine.
Now, we aren't # to <eob> wake up xxxxxxxx <eol> xxx xx able to heal <eob> Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next # <eob> Tuesday, either.
But with these # <eol> advances, <eol> and xxxxxxx # with our immune system <eol> to help and heal wounds, <eob> could xxxxx xxxxxx <eol> products # the market <eob> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eol> xx # help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe <eob> day be # able # keep pace xxxx a salamander. <eol>

So, as # a child, <eob> I used # to spend # of xx # time at my great-grandmother's house. <eol>
On hot, # humid, summer # days, <eol> I dash # the # floor <eol> and xxxxx my xxxx front # of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that experience, <eob> though brief, <eol> a privileged # xxx xxx community. <eob>
Growing stories next-door xxxxxxxxx <eol> having xx set up fake energy accounts <eol> or xxxxxx seemed normal # <eob>
During the winter, struggling to get <eol> xx xxxxxxxxx would xxxx no choice <eol> but # to # the <eol> after their heat # was xxxx <eob> off, <eol> xxxx # keep their # family <eol> comfortable one # day. <eob>
These xx dangerous <eol> incidents # can take root <eol> when people are # xxxxx <eol> with choices. <eob>
In the <eol> US, xxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eol> percent of their # income on energy.
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and rural xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> can spend # 20, even xx percent <eob> of their income on xxxxxxx <eob>
2015, xxxx caused over <eob> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx <eob> xx provide power to # their homes. <eob>
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden. <eob>
xxxxxx burdens are # so xxxx <eob> xxxx just x number. <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx choices: <eob> Do you take your child to her # flu medicine, <eol> xx do # you <eol> feed her? <eob>
Or do you # keep her <eob>
xxxx an choice, <eob> and # month, <eob> seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy. <eol>
This a xxxx # larger <eol> and systemic xxxxxx <eol>
Families <eob> with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people xx color, <eob> who spend <eol> xxxx xxx <eob> xxxx <eol> than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # <eob> veterans <eol> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx <eol> mass <eob> of 37 million xxxxxx # a xxxx <eob> who are xxxxxx to xxxxxx energy <eol> for # xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those # with <eol> high <eob> energy # burdens <eob> have # a greater likelihood # of conditions like # heart <eob> disease and # asthma. <eob>
Look # -- given our # rockets # xx Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, we have the <eol> tools to # xxxxxxx <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eob>
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx and smart xxxx # technology <eob> are # decreasing.
even as we <eob> the majority of <eob> xxxxx who own <eol> # much more # than the average American.
This is why, <eob> when # I was 22, <eol> I <eob> founded the nonprofit RETI. <eol>
# is to alleviate energy burdens <eol> by working with communities, <eob> utilities and # <eol> xxxxxxxxxx alike provide <eol> to # energy, <eob> energy energy technology.
But # there's no one way <eob> to solve this. <eol>
I believe in # the xxxxx of # local <eol> in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect of relationships. <eob>
So xx by working directly <eob> the communities <eol> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx <eob>
We host <eol> and events # for communities <eob> to # xxxxxx poverty, and how making even <eol> updates to their homes like xxxxxx insulation windows <eob> and heaters # go # x long way # xx # maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting <eob> to community # solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart # home <eol> research <eob> and # installation xxxxxxxx to <eob> help families bring # <eob> down <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're xxxx working # directly <eol> with elected # <eob> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eob> of # energy and resilience <eob> we <eob> have to xxxx together <eob> sustainably. <eob>
Now, the US # spends <eob> over # three <eob> billion a year energy bill payment # <eob>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eob> millions # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they're only able xx help <eol> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eob>
In xxxxx <eol> there is 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy equity <eol> and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure and <eob> impartial access to energy that <eob> clean, <eol> reliable and <eol> affordable. <eob>
At # scale, microgrid technology, <eob> xxx energy efficiency <eol> dramatically # improve xxxxxx health.
And for those <eob> xxxx # high burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent xx their income -- <eob> xx # percent of a person's income <eol> struggling to make xxxx # meet. <eob>
xxxx is life-changing. <eol>
This is xx <eol> for # use # their energy savings to sponsor their future. <eob>
I xxxxx # back to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eob> xxx impossible choices xxxx # they xxxx <eol> and the effect it had <eol> on xxxxx <eob>

There are xxxxxxxx nationwide # having <eol> to make the # same xxxxxxx xxxxxx
And # high energy burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but through relationships with communities technology, <eol> we have # the paths to overcome them. <eob>

Now, what does this have to xx <eob> with xxx one # us?
it's # one xxx # of illustrating <eob> # what <eol> I xxxxxxx to xx the # most xxxxxxxxx change <eob> that needed in ways of xxxxxxx
The world # is # getting faster <eol> and more complex, <eob> so we # need <eob> a # way of working, a way # xxxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxx # purpose, <eob> xxxx takes out xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that <eob> xxxxx empowers people to make faster.
But # the # question is: <eol> In # order # to # get there, <eob> are xx # willing to # xxxx up? <eob>
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eol> that wanted to # embark <eol> a digital transformation. <eob>
wanted their offering to be # <eob> intuitive, more relevant.
Now, I'm xxx sure how many of you # a # bank from the inside, <eol> so let me try to illustrate <eol> # xxxx traditional banks like.
You see lots # of people # suits <eob> taking elevators xx go to department, <eol> sitting with marketers, <eol> xxxxxxxxx with engineers, # etc. <eol>
You see meetings # 20 # people <eob> nothing gets <eob>
Great xxxxxx <eob> They end up <eob> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eob>
xxx there are endless # handovers <eol> xxxxxxx <eob>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx <eol>
this # xxxx <eol> xxxx in to transform, <eol> would have xx # improve <eob> time to market <eob> by changing <eol> their ways xx working as well. <eol>
But <eol> xxxx <eob>
To # <eob> get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx to xxx <eob> have x look companies that seem # to xx more innovative, <eol> like Google, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And remember how <eob> we xxxx # the halls at xxx xx these # companies in # December 2014, <eob> a <eob> xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and a xxxx # xx bankers. <eob>
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, surrounded # by beanbags and hoodies <eol> and smart, # creative xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we # asked, <eol> xxxx # is # your company organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx to # get org # <eob> chart. <eob>
But instead, they used <eol> strange drawings <eob> with <eob> funny # names like # and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx explain how xxxx were organized.
So then tried to # <eol> that # our own world. <eol>
We # xxxxxx <eob> "How <eob> many # people <eob> are xxxxxxx for you?" <eob> "It depends".
"Who you xxxxxx to?" <eol> depends". <eol>
xxxxxxx xx xxxx priorities?" <eol> xxx depends". <eol>
You <eob> can our surprise. <eob>
xx were # xxxxxx for what we thought <eob> xx the basic principles <eol> of organizations, <eob> and answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, over the # course <eob> # of that day, <eob> we gained <eol> understanding of <eob> # <eob>
They believed <eol> in xxx power <eol> of xxxxxx <eol> autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups. <eob>
They xxx product people <eol> engineers in the same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eob> and # test ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx <eob> independently of xxxxxx in # the company. <eob>
xxxx # did not <eol> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They all the skills <eol> needed there in the team.
xxxx # at end of that day, <eol> xx had a <eol> to reflect xx what we # had learned.
And <eob> we started to # xxxx # their <eob> so # we already thinking xx how <eol> xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eob>
then, one <eob> # of the hosts, guy # who # had <eob> not # said a word # all # <eob> he suddenly xxxxx <eob> xxx <eob> x see you like xxx model. <eob>
But I # have one for # you: <eol> What # are you to give xxxx <eol> we willing # to give up? <eob>
xxx not # xxxx # an answer immediately, <eob> xxx we # knew # xx was right. <eol>
Change is only about <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eol> the xxxx <eob> it's about giving <eob> some of old <eol> as well. <eob>
Now, over # the # past years, <eol> I worked with companies <eol> all <eob> # xxxx # the world <eob> to change their xxxx xx # working.
And clearly, every company <eol> has xxx skeptics about why this is <eob> xxxxx xx for <eol> them. <eob>
"Our # is more complex," <eob> or # have the xxxxxx # xx # like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators just won't allow this <eol> in our # <eob> industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx bank and also <eol> for the other <eob> companies <eol> xxxx x # have <eob> worked with <eob> change was possible. <eob>
a year, # we up old silos <eob> between # marketing, <eob> product, channels and xxx <eob>
Three # employees # were <eol> into <eob> 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams.
So instead of product people <eob> sitting just with # people engineers engineers, <eob> x product # person and an engineer <eol> xxxx now xxxxxxx of xxx xxxxx <eob>
You could be a xxxxxx of a <eol> team <eol> responsible for account opening <eob> or for xxx mobile # banking app, <eol> xxxx <eol>
At the go-live date <eol> of xxxx new organization, people were xxxxxxx hands for # very # xxxxx # <eol> time, <eol> only <eob> to find xxx xxxx been xxxxxxx two minutes xxxx from # each other but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # <eob> reports for last 10 years. <eol>
You hear someone saying, "Ah, you're # the guy # that I <eol> xxxxxx chasing for answers". <eob> <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee xxxxxxxx every
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just # <eob> raise # it <eob> to get input from the engineer <eol> xxx # is # sitting <eob> right next # to him. <eol>
They xxxxxx test <eob> with customers immediately # -- <eob> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # no <eob> xxx tape, just xxxxxxx stuff
# getting there <eob> is not # easy. <eob>
And # it # turns out, <eob> are # you willing to give up?" <eob> is # exactly # right <eob> # to xxxx <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eol> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
xxxxxxx # of going <eol> up xxx # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx xx want # xxx team to # decide. <eob>
xx do we need xxx the skills <eol> and for xxxx <eol> in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs. <eob>
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # who are working # in different <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eob> different xxxxxxxxx # today?
xx should we invest in better videoconferencing? <eob>
how do # we xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things across # xxxxxx <eol>
We still need some xxxx <eol> of management <eob> xxxxxxx
# these changes to structure and process procedure -- <eob> they xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, <eob> x found the most difficult thing <eob> to change <eob> is our own behavior. <eol>
Let xx try to illustrate. <eob>
If we # these teams to be fast, <eob> flexible, creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they <eol> have # to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this xxxxx xx # xxxxxx <eob> # have xxxxxxx <eol> commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, # how # xxx <eol>
No micromanagers. <eob>
But # it also # each employee needs to become leader, <eob> regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title.
It's # about all of # us up <eol> to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now obviously, we also <eob> cannot afford <eob> to have all # teams <eob> xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> because # that would <eol> certainly lead # to chaos. <eol>
# we need and # autonomy <eob> at # same <eol> just xxxx a <eob> flock # of birds. <eol>
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eob> this requires new behaviors, and # each new behavior, <eob> there xx on something as # well. <eob>
Leaders have to # make <eob> sure <eol> xxxx everyone # in xxx organization <eol> is aligned around <eob> the overall <eol> purpose the why <eol> and the -- what. <eob>
But # then <eol> xxxx xxxx let go <eol> # trust their # teams <eol> to the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eob>
But <eob> you know # how say <eol> that information is a source <eob> of xxxxxx
Well, <eol> for some managers, <eob> xxxxxxx information may feel as # if <eob> they're giving up xxxx power.
xxx it's <eob> # not just managers. <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and <eob> transparently as well.
these # the # xxxxx typically <eob> work in short # sprints, <eob> and at <eob> the end # # sprint, <eol> they organize # a demo session <eob> xx share # the output <eol> of # what they've done, transparently. <eol>
xxxx <eob> each member of the <eob> xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working xx
Now, all this transparency <eol> be uncomfortable xxx people, <eol> # xxxxxxxxx there # is <eol> xx <eob> place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do <eol> xx transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, # alignment # is not easy, <eob> xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is not so obvious, either.
One <eob> executive # at # another company <eob> to explain he used to <eob> be <eol> a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx instead of looking at # status reports, <eob> he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # the team floors <eol> attend one of their sessions. <eob>
xxx instead of <eob> # telling people what xx <eob> looks # ways <eob> # to help them. <eob>
is <eol> radical change <eob> for # someone # who used # xx be <eob> master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, <eob> this executive said, <eob> "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eol>
In xxxxxxxx many # projects would run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
xxx I have # more # transparency, <eob> I can course-correct much # <eob> earlier if needed". <eob>
And managers need to # change as well. <eob>
First # of all, the handovers <eol> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was <eol> this idea of <eol> thinkers and # <eob>
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx <eob>
xxx instead xx only <eol> managing other # <eol> people, <eob> middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches. <eob>
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, <eob> you have just been other people what to xxx but now xxxxxx expected <eol> to # # # again. <eob>
Clearly, this model is not for everyone, <eob> and great people # leave the <eob> # company. <eol>
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
xxx of this is hard <eob>
xxx # it's worth it. <eob>
xxx companies <eob> that I <eob> were xxxxxxxxx new # features # few times <eob>
xxx they have releases every few # # without # xxxxxxxxx the xxx <eob> tape, <eob> whole xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> becomes more efficient.
And # if you walk the # halls <eol> xx these today, you just <eob> feel a new energy. <eob>
It # feels as if you're # xxxxxxx <eol> the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, these xxxxxxxxxx they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eob>
But at least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared <eol> to # respond to <eol>
xxxxx is getting faster <eol> and more # xxxxxxxx <eol> so we # need # to reboot <eob> # our way of working. <eob>
And the xxxxxxx part that change <eol> is not # structure or process # and xxxx also not <eol> senior taking charge. <eob>
Leaders xx all of those in # the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
all have # to lead the # change. <eol>

xx long as they can find good # Wi-Fi, <eob> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eol> didn't <eob> happen accidentally.
It was a conscious choice <eol> from the very # beginning.
Notice x don't xxx xxx word # "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eob> xxxx <eol> some are essential <eol> and some aren't.
use xxx <eol> word "distributed" <eol> xxxxxxxx # what we do, <eob> where everyone xx on # <eob> xxxxxxx field. <eob>
I think a # distributed workforce <eob> is # most effective xxx <eol> to # company. <eob>
The key is you have to # consciously. <eob>
When we <eob> xxxxxxx WordPress, <eob> many of # xxx first <eob> # 20 # hires xxxx people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd collaborated # <eol> xxx years. <eob>
I # wanted to continue xxxx <eol> for one # reason. <eol>
I believe # that talent and <eob> are equally distributed <eob> the world. <eob> is # not. <eob>
In <eol> the tech xxxxxxxxx fish <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx the # same # small or xxxx <eol>
A # distributed # company xxx fish from # the entire <eol> ocean. <eob>
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # who # grew up <eol> in xxxxx # but lives in California, <eob> # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eob> wakes up and goes <eob> to sleep <eol> wherever they are xx # world. <eob> They <eob> bring a # <eob> understanding # of <eol> xxxx # culture and # a different lived <eol> experience. <eob>
At the base of xxx <eol> decision <eol> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # how <eob> # xxxx do their work. <eol>
Unless you're <eob> in a <eol> where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, you can make your # own schedule. <eol>
Everyone have a xxxxxx office, <eol> xxxxx windows, the food they want to eat, <eob> you # can choose there's music <eob> xxx when silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx the xxxx should be. <eob>
You can save the <eol> time <eol> spend commuting <eol> and put xx into things <eol> that important xx <eob>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is ideal a # company. <eob>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, <eob> "This works for y'all, <eol> xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # an # xxxxxxx xxx # <eob> do # few xxxxxx <eol> to # build distributed
First: document everything.
In xx it's easy <eob> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, <eob> in the kitchen, # in <eol> xxx
But <eob> if # people work remotely <eob> and some <eol> members of the team <eol> are <eob> having conversations <eob> they xxxxx xxxx access they'll these xxxxxxxxx being made <eol> without <eob> understanding the xxxx <eol>
Always leave x trail # of <eob> xxxxx you were <eol> and what xxx were thinking about. <eol>
This # allows others <eol> pick xx <eol> you # left off.
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eol> time zones <eob> xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> it's great to think <eol> as # an organization people and xxxxxx
have <eol> as much communication as possible xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows # people up <eol>
You xxxx xxxx to find xxx # <eob>
There xxx so xxxx apps and <eol> xxxxxxxx that help # with day-to-day communication, xxxxx conferencing, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx
The things # that changed how <eob> # <eob> you xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob> aren't objects # anymore.
They're things you access <eob> through your xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So xxxxxxxxxx with xxxxxxxxx tools that enable # collaboration, see what works.
Create productive, face-to-face # time. <eob>
In a xxxxxxxxxxx office, <eob> xxxxxx # in the xxxx place <eol> xx weeks out of the year <eob> and you # might <eol> three four # xxxxx apart. <eob>
We <eol> try to # flip # <eob> we # come together <eol> for short, <eob> intense bursts. <eob> a # year xx # do a grand # <eob> xxxxx xxx entire <eob> company <eol> comes for a <eob> week.
It's half-work, <eol> half-play. <eol>
The primary goal is people. <eob> xxxx to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and on <eob> xxxx page, <eob> and xxxx xxxx # a deeper <eol> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # <eob> the rest xx <eob> the year, they can bring together <eob> that xxxxxxxxxxxxx and empathy. <eob>
And the xxxxx practice: <eob> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xx their # own work environment. <eob>
Every person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx put <eob> towards a co-working # xxxxx <eob> or to buy so # they <eob> don't <eol> out <eob> of xxx coffee shop. <eol>
One # in <eol> Seattle <eol> xx <eob> pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a # on x xxxxxxx pier. <eob>
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eol> gets x home-office stipend. <eol>
xxxx # is money can invest <eol> xxxxxxx xxx # right # chair, monitor, <eol> # right xxxx so # <eob> they can have <eol> the most productive environment # xxx them. <eob>
Today, there are just a # few xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx <eol>
In a decade or # xxxx <eol> x predict that 90 percent of companies <eob> that are to be # changing the # course of xxx xxxxx are going function way. <eol>
They will <eob> to be distributed # first, <eol> or # they'll # be replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx <eob> you xxxxx xxxxx <eol> what you're # going xx xxxxx next, <eob> consider xxx # you can tap <eob> into # global talent, <eob> give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work where they # feel they should and still # participate fully whatever <eol> it # is you're creating together. <eol>
