Imagine waking up to # a stranger xx <eol> sometimes multiple strangers # -- questioning your right to for something that # you wrote online, waking up to an # <eob> scared <eob> # and worried for your safety. <eob>
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The kind of # harassment that women <eob> xxxx in # xxxxxxxx is <eob> very # serious and leads sometimes xxxxxx outcomes. <eob>
This kind # of xxxxxxxxxx women accessing # xxx internet # -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a form of # oppression. <eob>
Pakistan xx the sixth most populous <eob> xxxxxxx in the world, <eob> with 140 million people having access <eol> to <eob> mobile technologies, and 15 # percent penetration.
And this number doesn't to go xxxx with the # rise of new # technologies. <eol>
Pakistan is also xxx birthplace <eob> # xxx # youngest # Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eol>
# that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eol>
xxxxxxx aspect is <eol> where the twisted concept of honor <eob> is # linked xx # women # their <eob> bodies; <eol> where men are allowed to disrespect # women <eol> and # even # kill them sometimes <eob> in the name of so-called # "family honor"; <eob> where women are xxxx <eol> to die <eol> right outside <eob> their # houses <eob> for speaking to # x man # on a mobile phone, <eob> in the name of "family <eob> honor". <eob>
Let me xxx this very clearly: <eob> it's # not <eob> # honor; <eob> it's cold-blooded <eol>
I <eob> come from a # very small village <eob> in Punjab, # Pakistan, <eol> where are not # allowed <eob> pursue their higher education.
The elders # of <eol> my extended <eob> didn't allow their women to pursue xxxxxx education <eol> or professional careers. <eob>
However, unlike the # other <eol> male guardians of # my family, <eob> my father one xxx <eob> really <eol> my ambitions.
To get my law xxxxxxx <eol> of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] xxxxxx of disapproval. <eob>
But # in the end, I knew <eol> it's xxxxxx me or them, <eob> and I chose myself. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
My family's <eol> traditions and expectations for a woman <eol> # allow # me xx own a mobile <eol> phone until x was married. <eob>
And # xxxx <eob> when x # married, <eob> tool became a <eob> for <eol> my <eob> # surveillance. <eob>
When I resisted idea of being surveilled my he # <eob> really didn't approve of this xxx threw out of xxx house, <eob> along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eol>
And was the <eol> time <eol> xxxx I first xxxxx myself, "Why?
Why are women not allowed to # enjoy # the xxxxx rights <eol> enshrined <eob> in our Constitution?
While the law that a woman <eob> has the same equal access <eol> xx the information, why is # always men -- brothers, fathers # and husbands xx <eob> # xxx granting these rights # to <eol> us, xxxxxxxxxxx making the # law <eob> irrelevant?" <eob>
So I to take a # step, <eob> instead <eob> of xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> these patriarchal <eob> and societal <eob>
I founded the xxxxxxx Rights <eol> Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the <eob> # issues <eol> and women's # in online spaces and # cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx lobbying # <eob> free and safe internet to convincing young # women <eob> that xxxxxx to xxx safe internet <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human right, <eob> I'm trying to my part <eol> in igniting the spark xx address xxx questions <eol> that xxxx bothered me xxx these years. <eob>
With a <eol> hope in xx and to offer a solution to menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the <eob> region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line in December 2016 xx <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx extend my <eol> # support # to xxx women <eol> xxx not xxxx who # xx turn to <eob> face xxxxxxx # threats # <eob> online. <eol>
I think # <eob> xx the xxx do # <eob> xxx have <eob> the necessary support <eol> to deal with the mental <eol> trauma <eob> xxxx feel unsafe <eob> in <eol> online xxxxxxx <eob> xxx they xx about xxxxx activities, <eol> thinking # that there is x rape # threat their in-box. <eol>
access to the <eob> internet an # access <eob> to <eob> xxx # xxxxxxxxx xx freedom. <eob>
When I fight for women's digital rights, <eol> I'm # for equality. <eol>
Thank you. <eol>

We're at a xxxxxxxx # moment.
xxxxxxxx <eob> xx our # xxxxx institutions <eol> are failing us. <eol>
Why?
In some # cases, because they're <eol> or <eob> but often, they've taken <eol> to the objectives. <eob>
And this is # <eob>
This has to #
How are we going to # correct these wrongs? <eob>
How # we <eob> xx choose xxx right course?
xxxx not xxxxx to easy.
xxx # I've with talented teams <eol> and they've chosen # the right objectives <eol> and <eol> # the wrong objectives. <eol>
Many have succeeded, <eol> xxxxxx of them failed.
And xxxxx I'm # to share with <eob> what really makes a difference -- <eob> that's xxxxxx crucial, <eob> how and why they # set meaningful and xxxxxx the xxxxx xxxxx the
Let's go <eob> # back # <eol> xxxxx <eob>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've a lot to learn, <eol> xxx a computer # engineer, <eob> I've # got long hair, but I'm # working under Andy xxxxxx <eob> who's been xxxxxx the greatest manager of # his or # any other <eol>
Andy a superb # leader <eol> and also a teacher, <eol> he said to # xxx # "John, it almost doesn't matter what xxx know. <eob>
is # what matters # <eol> the most".
And # xx # invented a system <eob> called "Objectives # and # <eob>
It kind of <eol> rolls off <eol> the tongue, doesn't it? <eol>
xxxx xxxxx excellent execution. <eob>
So x xxxxxxx video from the 1970s <eol> of professor Andy Grove. <eol>
(Video) Andy Grove: # <eob> The two key phrases of the xxxxxxxxxx by objective systems <eol> xxx the objectives the key results, <eob> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
The objective xx xxx <eob>
The key results have xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> but at # xxx end you xxx look <eob> xxx without # any argument say, <eob> "Did # I that, or did I # do that?" Yes. No. Simple.
xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eob>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or # OKRs, <eol> are a simple <eol> goal-setting system and they work for # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they work for teams, <eob> they # even <eob> work <eol> for individuals. <eob>
The objectives are what <eol> you # to have # accomplished. <eol>
The key results are how I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. Key results. <eol>
and how.
But here's <eol> many of us are <eob> setting goals wrong, <eob> most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eol>
A # lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eob> they introduce their new products, <eol> they make their but they lack a xxxxx of xxxxxxx to inspire teams. <eol>
So how do you set xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx way?
First, # you must xxxxxx <eob> the question, "Why?" <eob>
Because <eol> combine xxxxx ambitions <eob> to their passion <eob> and to purpose, <eob> and # develop a <eob> # <eob> clear <eol> and <eob> compelling sense of
I want tell # a story. <eol>
I work with a remarkable
Her name xx xxxx Kim. <eob>
She runs <eol> a company xxxxxx Nuna. <eob>
# is health xxxx data company. <eol>
And when <eob> Nuna was # founded, <eob> they used data to serve health needs of <eob> lots of workers <eol> at large companies. <eob>
And # xxxx two # <eol> years into the company's xxxxx the xxxxxxx issued a <eol> build the xxxxx ever cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, you'll xxxxxxxx that Medicaid is that program <eol> that <eob> serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our poor, our children <eob> and people # with <eob> disabilities.
Nuna at the time # was just 15 <eol> # people <eob> and database <eol> had to xx # built in one <eol> # year, <eob> and they a whole set of <eol> that they had to honor, <eob> and <eol> frankly, weren't going to make <eol> very much money on # project. <eol>
This xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx moment, and Jini # seized it. <eol>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eob> She not flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, <eob> it's a personal
xxxxxx younger brother Kimong has autism. <eol>
And when # he was seven, <eob> xx # had # his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. <eol>
He fell to xxx ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents are immigrants. <eol>
They # came <eob> to the <eob> with limited resources <eob> speaking little xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> enroll her family in Medicaid.
She was xxxx years # old. <eob>
That moment defined her xxxxxxxx and <eob> that mission became <eob> her company, <eob> and xxxx company bid on, # and delivered on # that contract. <eob>
Here's Jini to tell you why. <eob>
(Video) Jini # Kim: Medicaid <eob> saved xx xxxxxx <eob> from # bankruptcy, <eol> and today it xxxxxxxx # for Kimong's health <eob> and # millions of others. <eob>
Nuna # xx xx xxxx # letter to Medicaid. <eob>
Every <eol> row of data is <eob> # a life <eob> whose story deserves <eob> be told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's story xx <eol> that # a xxxxxxxxxx sense of why <eol> xxx # be for our <eob>
Remember, that's what <eob> we want to have accomplished.
And xxxxxxxxxx are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eol> are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and they're a <eob> kind of vaccine <eol> against xxxxx thinking. <eol>
You xxxxx a <eob> be <eob> an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key <eob> but # for years, Bono # has used OKRs <eob> to wage a global war <eob> against poverty # and disease, <eob> and his ONE organization <eob> has on two really gorgeous, objectives. <eob>
The first is debt relief <eob> for xxx # <eob> poorest countries in the <eob> world. <eob>
The next is xxxxxxxxx access to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, # why are these # good objectives? <eob>
Let's <eob> go back xxx <eob>
Significant? Check. xxxxxxxxx # Yes. <eol>
Yes. <eol>
Inspirational?
Well, let's just listen to Bono. <eob>
xxxxxxx xxxxx So you're passionate? <eob>
How # passionate? <eob>
What actions does your # passion <eol> lead xxx <eob>
If the # heart doesn't xxxx <eob> a perfect rhyme with the head, <eob> then # xxxx passion means <eob> nothing. <eob>
OKR framework <eob> cultivates the madness, the chemistry xxxxxxxxx inside <eol> # it. <eol>
It gives us # an environment for risk, <eol> <eob> where xxxxxxx is not a offense. <eol>
And when that sort <eol> of structure and environment <eob> and the right xxxxxxx magic is around # the xxxxxxx <eol>
JD: I love that. <eob>
xxxx the madness, and magic is right around the corner.
This is perfect. <eob>
with Jini covered the <eob> Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eob>
turn our attention <eob> xx the hows. <eob>
the the xxx results. <eol> we meet our # objectives. <eob>
And good results <eol> specific
They're aggressive realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx # measurable, <eob> they're <eob>
Those are good key results. <eob>
1999, I introduced <eol> OKRs <eob> to xxxxxxxx cofounders, <eob> Larry and <eol> Sergey. <eob>
Here they xxxx <eol> 24 xxxxx old in their garage. <eob>
And xxxxxx <eob> enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt # them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
xxxx # he really # said was, <eol> "We don't # have # any other xxx <eol> to this xxxxxxxx so we'll # it a go". <eob> (Laughter)
And # <eob> x took xxxx # as a kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every quarter since # then, every Googler has xxxxxxx <eob> her objectives and <eob> key results.
They've # graded them, <eob> and # they've published <eob> everyone to see. <eol>
And these are <eob> not for bonuses or for promotions. <eol>
They're set xxxxxx <eob>
They're used x higher purpose, <eob> xxx to xxx # <eob> collective # xxxxxxxxxx to truly # stretch goals.
In 2008, a # Googler, xxxxxx Pichai, took # on xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> which was to <eol> the # next generation xxxxxx platform for # the # future xx web applications -- <eob> # words, build the best browser. <eob>
xx was # thoughtful how # he chose key results.
How measure the best browser? <eob>
It be ad # xx engagement. <eob>
xxx He said: numbers users, <eob> because users are # <eob> going decide <eol> if Chrome is a <eol> great browser or not. <eol>
So he had one <eob> three-year-long objective: <eob> xxxxx the <eob> xxxx # browser. <eob>
And then every <eol> he stuck to the same key <eob> results, <eob> numbers of users, but he upped xxx ante. <eob>
xx # the first year, <eob> his was 20 <eob> million users <eob> he xxxxxx it. <eob>
He # less 10. <eob>
Second year, he # raised <eol> the bar to million.
xx got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better.
In # the third year, <eob> he <eob> upped xxx ante xxxx more <eob> to a hundred million. <eol>
He launched an aggressive marketing campaign, <eob> broader <eob> improved the technology, and kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 xxxxxxx users. <eob>
why # I like this story, <eol> so much for the # ending, it xxxxx # <eol> choosing the right objective and then xxxxxxxx to year after year after year. <eob>
It's a xxxxxxx story for a # xxxx like me. <eob>
Now, I think xx OKRs <eob> as vessels that are <eob> made from the whats hows of # ambitions. <eob>
What really matters is the why that we # pour into those vessels. <eob>
That's why <eob> we # do our work. <eob>
are # a bullet. <eol>
They're not going to be <eob> a # substitute for a # strong culture <eob> or for stronger # leadership, <eob> but # when those fundamentals are in place, <eob> xxxx # can take xxx to mountaintop. <eob>
I xxxx xx think <eol> about life # a moment.
Do you right xxxxxxxx <eob>
Take time to # write down xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> your objectives and your results.

What is # history? <eob>
It is something # written by the <eob> winners. <eol>
xxxxx is # stereotype that # history should be focused on the rulers, <eol> like Lenin or <eob>
As a <eol> # result, people <eol> many like # Russia, xxxx at history as something that # was predetermined <eob> xx determined # by the xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could # not <eol> in any <eob> # way. <eob>
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eob> that Russia could ever <eob> have been <eol> or ever be a democratic nation, and this is to the way has been framed <eob> to the xxxxxxxx of Russia. <eob>
And this <eol> xx not true. <eob>
xx prove it, I spent two years <eob> my xxxx trying to go 100 years back, <eob> # <eol> the year # <eob> the of the <eob> Revolution. <eob>
I # asked # <eob> myself, if the <eob> and Facebook xxxxxxx # 100 years ago? <eol>
So # last year, we <eob> xxxxx a network for dead <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team <eob> and x created our # software, digitized and uploaded <eol> xxx possible real diaries and letters xxxxxxx # more people <eob> years ago. <eob>
So any xx our website xx application can follow # a news feed <eol> for each day of # xxxx <eob> xxxx what people <eol> like Stravinsky or <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eob> and xxxxxx thought # and xxxxx
We watch all those xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> # ordinary people like you and # me, <eob> not demigods, and <eol> we see xxxx history consists <eol> of their mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not <eob> only their "genius ideas". <eol>
Our project was a xxxxx for xxxx Russians, <eob> who used to <eob> xxxxx that our country <eol> has always # been an autocratic <eol> empire <eob> and xxx ideas of freedom democracy <eob> could # <eob> never have # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> just # <eob> democracy xxx not our # destiny. <eob>
But if take x broader look, <eob> it's not that xxxxx and white. <eob>
Yes, 1917 # led to # 70 <eol> xxxxx <eol> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But <eol> with this xxxxxxxx we # # that Russia <eol> could xxx a different history <eol> and <eob> a democratic future, <eol> xx any xxxxx country could # still can. <eob>
Reading # the xxxxx from xxxxx you xxxxx that xxxxxx <eob> was xxx first country # xx the # xxxxx abolish # the death <eol> # xxxxxxxx <eol> or one of first ones <eol> to grant # women voting xxxxxxx
Knowing <eob> history and understanding how ordinary people influenced <eol> history can us create a better # future, <eob> because just a <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob> of # what's happening right xxxx <eol>
We do need new # ways of # telling <eob> and year, example, we a new project that is # called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and <eob> is series <eol> that gives you an impression <eob> of that year, # 1968, year marked xx global social xxxxxx <eob> that, <eob> in many ways, created the <eob> xxxxx as we know now.
xxx we # <eob> are making that history # alive <eob> by imagining xxxx if all main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eob> just like that? <eol>
And we # see that a lot of individuals were <eol> facing # the same challenges and # were fighting for the same # <eol> values, no matter if they lived # or in <eol> or in France <eob> or xx China <eol> or Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history in such democratic way, through social media, we # show that people in power not the only xxxx xxxxxx # choices. <eob>
xxxx # gives xxx user possibility reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an xxxxxxx <eob>

Computer algorithms # today <eob> are performing incredible tasks with high accuracies, <eol> at a xxxxxxx scale, <eob> using human-like <eob>
And this intelligence xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> is often to <eol> as AI <eob> or artificial # intelligence. <eol>
AI is # poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on our lives # xx the future. <eol>
Today, <eob> we still <eol> face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eob> several illnesses, <eob> xxxx as infectious diseases and cancer. <eol>
Thousands xx patients every year <eol> lose their <eob> lives due to liver and oral <eol>
best way to help these patients <eol> is to perform <eob> xxxxx detection <eob> and # <eob> of these diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, can artificial intelligence help?
In patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eol> an expert # physician xxxxx orders <eol> expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies <eob> such as fluorescent imaging, CTs, MRIs, # to # be performed. <eob>
those images are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> another xxxxxxxxx xxxx # diagnoses <eob> # images to the patient. <eol>
As you can xxxx # xxxx is <eol> a very # resource-intensive process, expert physicians, expensive medical # technologies, <eob> and # is not considered practical <eol> for the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in xxxxx in <eol> xxxx industrialized # nations, as well.
So, we # solve this problem <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # were # to use traditional <eob> artificial intelligence architectures <eol> to this <eol> problem, I would require # 10,000 -- <eol> I # <eol> repeat, on <eob> an order of xxxxxx of very expensive <eob> medical xxxxxx <eol> first to be generated.
After # xxxxx I would then # <eob> go <eol> to physician, <eob> who then # analyze <eob> those xxxxxx xxx me. <eob>
And using those two pieces of information, <eob> I <eob> # <eob> can <eol> train a standard # deep neural xxxxxxx <eob> or a xxxx learning network <eob> to xxxxxxx # patient's # <eob>
Similar # # xxx approach, <eol> traditional artificial intelligence # approaches <eob> xxxxxx from the same <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert xxxxxxxxxx and expert <eob> medical <eob> technologies.
So, <eob> can xx invent # <eol> more effective <eob> and xxxx # valuable artificial <eob> intelligence architectures <eob> to <eob> solve xxxxx very problems facing xx today? <eob>
And is exactly <eol> what group xx MIT xxxxx does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox <eol> architectures <eol> to solve some xx the # xxxx important <eob> challenges facing <eob> us today <eol> xx # <eob> medical imaging and # clinical xxxxxxx <eob>
In the example I <eol> with xxx today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first was xx reduce the <eob> number <eol> of images <eob> required to train artificial intelligence # algorithms. <eob>
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious, <eob> xx wanted to # reduce the # use <eol> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eol> to screen xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So how did # we it? <eol>
# our xxxxx <eob> goal, instead starting <eob> with tens # <eob> and <eob> thousands <eob> of very # expensive <eob> # medical <eol> like # traditional AI, <eol> started with a single medical image. <eob>
this image, my team and I xxxxxxx out a very <eob> # clever way to extract <eob> billions <eol> of information <eol> packets. <eob>
These <eol> packets included colors, pixels, geometry and # rendering of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eob>
xx a sense, we xxxxxxxxx one <eol> # image <eob> into # of data <eob> points, <eol> massively reducing the amount # # data <eol> needed xxxxxxxxx <eob>
For our second goal, <eol> xx reduce the use of expensive # medical <eol> imaging technologies to xxxxxx patients, <eob> xx # with # x standard, <eob> # photograph, <eob> acquired either from x DSLR camera <eol> x mobile xxx # the # patient.
Then remember xxxxx billions information # packets?
overlaid xxxxx xxxx <eob> the medical xxxxx onto this image, <eol> creating xxxxxxxxx that we a <eob> # composite xxxxxx <eob>
Much to our # surprise, <eol> we xxxx required <eob> # -- <eob> I repeat, 50 of composite xxxxxx to train <eol> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To # summarize our <eob> approach, <eol> instead of using <eob> 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eol> we can now <eob> the AI # <eob> an unorthodox <eob> way, using <eob> only <eol> of these high-resolution, but standard photographs, <eob> acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> and <eol> mobile xxxxxxx <eol> and diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms accept, <eol> in the future xxxx right # now, <eol> some very simple, # xxxxx photographs from # the patient, # of xxxxxxxxx <eob> imaging technologies. <eol>
I xxxxxxx # that we are poised <eob> to enter an era xxxxx artificial intelligence is going to # make an <eob> impact on our future.
And I think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about traditional AI, which is application-poor, <eob> xx should also continue thinking unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence <eol> which # can accept small amounts of data <eob> xxx # some the most <eol> problems xxxxxx us today, <eob> especially # in health care.
xxxxx you very <eol>

What # if # you could take # a or vaccine and, just like # getting # over <eob> a xxxxx <eob> you could # heal your wounds # faster? <eob>
Today, if we have an operation or xx accident, we're in the hospital for # weeks, <eol> and often left with <eob> scars <eob> and # side effects <eob> of our inability xx regenerate <eol> or regrow <eob> # healthy, uninjured <eol>
I work to create materials <eob> that instruct our immune to give <eol> the signals to <eob> grow tissues.
Just like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to xxxxx disease, <eol> could instead instruct <eol> xxx immune system <eob> to build # tissues <eol> and more quickly xxxx # wounds. <eob>
Now, body xxxxx out # of xxxxxxx <eol> might seem like magic, but <eob> there are # several organisms that can # achieve this <eob>
Some xxx # regrow their the humble salamander <eol> can # completely regenerate their # arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of <eol> its # original mass.
To make this magic <eob> a # bit closer to reality, <eol> I'm xxx xxx body <eol> can heal wounds and xxxxx tissue <eob> instructions <eob> from the xxxxxxx <eol>
From # <eol> a xxxxxx on xxxx knee <eol> that <eob> sinus <eol> our immune system defends <eol> our body from <eob> xxxxxxx <eol>
I'm an immunologist, <eob> # <eol> by using I <eob> know <eob> about xxx xxxxxx defense system, <eol> I # to identify key xxxxxxx our fight # xx build # back <eol> our cuts # and bruises. <eob>
When looking at materials <eob> that are currently being tested <eob> xxx <eob> their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eol> our team noticed that treating an injured muscle <eob> with # materials, <eob> there <eol> was a number of immune cells in # that material <eob> and the surrounding # muscle.
So this case, <eob> xxxxxxx of the xxxxxx cells # <eol> rushing off <eol> towards # <eob> infection xx # xxxxxxxxx <eob> they're <eob> rushing toward xxxxxxx
I discovered a # <eob> specific type of # cell, <eol> helper T <eob> # cell, <eol> xxx present inside that material that I <eol> implanted <eol> and absolutely critical for wound <eob> # healing.
Now, just # like when you were a kid you'd break pencil <eol> and try and tape it <eob> together again, <eol> can xxxxx but <eob> it not be <eol> in the most # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> way, <eol> and we'll get x scar. <eob>
So # xx we # don't these helper cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops <eol> fat # cells inside of xxx and # if fat in our muscle, <eob> xx isn't as strong. <eob>
using our <eol> immune <eob> system, <eob> our body <eob> could grow # xxxx <eol> without these scars <eol> xxx look like what it <eol> before we <eol> were even injured.
I'm to create materials <eob> that give <eob> us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the immune response. <eob>
We know xxxx any # time <eol> x material is implanted in our body, <eob> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it. <eol>
This # ranges from pacemakers <eob> insulin # pumps <eob> to materials that engineers using <eob> to and build new tissue.
So when I place # that <eol> or scaffold, in xxx body, the xxxxxx system creates <eol> a small environment # xx cells and # xxxxxxxx <eob> that # can change the way that our stem <eol> xxxxx behave.
Now, just like the weather <eob> affects <eob> xxx activities, <eob> like going for x run <eob> or staying <eob> inside # xxx binge-watching <eol> an # entire TV <eob> show on # xxxxxx of a <eob> affects the <eob> our stem <eob> cells grow # <eob> and # develop. <eol>
If we have the wrong # signals, say the xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> xx get fat <eol> cells instead # of muscle. <eol>
These scaffolds are <eol> xxxx xx a variety # of different things, <eob> from plastics to <eol> derived materials, <eob> of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less porous, <eob> gels of different stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eol> can even # xxx materials different <eob> signals over <eob> time. <eob>
So in other <eol> words, we # xxx orchestrate <eob> Broadway # show # of cells <eob> by giving them # <eob> the correct <eob> cues <eob> # and props <eob> that <eob> # can be xxxxxxx # for xxxxxxxxx # tissues, just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus xxxxxxx <eob> # Shop # of Horrors". <eol>
I'm # <eol> combining specific types of signals xxxx mimic how our <eob> body responds to injury <eol> to help xx regenerate. <eob>
In # the xx could xxx <eol> a scar-proof xxxxxxxxx <eob> x moldable muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx
Now, we aren't going to wake up <eob> and to <eob> heal <eob> like Wolverine. <eol>
Probably xxx next Tuesday, # either.
But # with these advances, <eob> and working # with # our <eol> immune system <eol> to help build # tissue and # xxxx # wounds, we # could begin seeing products on # the market <eol> that work with our xxxxxx defense system <eob> to help xx xx <eob> able <eol> to <eob> xxxx pace with <eol>
you. <eob>

So, # <eob> as a child, <eob> I used <eob> to spend of my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, humid, summer days, I would dash xxxxxx xxx floor <eol> xxx stick my face in front of <eol> her only # air <eob>
But didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> xxxxxx brief, <eob> was privileged # in our community. <eob>
Growing up, of <eob> xxxxxxxxx neighbors having # <eob> to # xxx <eol> fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed # normal to me. <eob>
xxxxxx winter, struggling to get warm, xx neighbors # have # no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their was shut off, just to keep <eol> their # family <eol> comfortable for xxx <eob> more day. <eol>
kinds of dangerous can root <eol> when people <eol> are # faced with xxxxxxxxxx choices.
In the US, xxxxxxx American spends <eol> three of xxxxx income energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income and rural populations <eol> can spend 20, even xx percent <eol> of their income on energy.
In 2015, this <eob> million # skip # meals <eob> # provide power to <eob> their homes.
This is # xxxx energy # a burden. <eol>
But energy are so much # more <eol> than just <eob> a # <eol>
They <eol> present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eol> Do you take your child <eol> to her flu medicine, <eob> do you feed her? <eob>
Or do xxx keep her warm? <eol>
It's an impossible xxxxxxx <eol> xxx <eol> nearly every month, <eol> seven million # people choose between medicine and <eol> energy.
This <eol> xxxxxxx x # much # xxxxxx <eob> and <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob>
Families # high energy burdens <eob> disproportionately people of color, <eol> who <eol> spend more per square foot <eol> than # their counterparts. <eob>
But also xxxxxxx and even xxxxxxxxxxxxxx who xxxx into the mass <eol> xx 37 # million people a year who xxx xxxxxx to afford <eol> for basic needs.
As a those with high energy burdens <eob> have a greater likelihood # # conditions <eob> like heart disease # asthma.
Look -- given our xxxxxxx to Mars <eob> and our pocket-sized AI, <eol> we have # the tools to <eol> address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is here. <eob>
Cost of # insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eol> are # all decreasing. <eol>
However, even xx xx # approach cost parity, the majority xx those own solar earn much more than the average # American.
xxxx is why, xxxx I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit # RETI. <eol>
Our xxxxxxx to alleviate energy burdens <eob> by working with # communities, utilities xxx agencies alike <eol> provide equitable <eob> access <eol> to # clean energy, <eob> energy xxxxxxxxxx and energy technology.
But xxxxxxx no one way to solve this. <eob>
believe in the power <eol> of local xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the transforming effect <eol> xx relationships.
we xxxxxxx <eob> directly <eol> with <eob> the xxxxxxxxxxx that have <eob> the highest energy burdens. <eol>
We host # workshops and events for <eob> to learn # about energy # poverty, and how making # even # small updates to their # homes <eob> like insulation for windows and <eob> water heaters <eol> can xx a long # way # to maximize # efficiency. <eob>
We're # connecting neighborhoods to community solar <eob> and spearheading xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> home research and # xxxxxxxx <eob> xx help xxxxxxxx bring down <eob> their energy # bills. <eol>
We're # even <eol> with officials, <eob> advocating # for # equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this <eob> vision of energy equity and <eob> resilience succeed, <eob> we have to work together sustainably. <eob>
Now, # the US spends <eol> over three # billion a year <eol> energy xxxx assistance.
And these programs xx help <eol> millions of people, but xxxxxxx xxxx to help <eol> a fraction of xxxxx need. <eob>
fact, <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar xxxxxxxxxxx affordability gap, so # xxxxx is not sustainable. <eob>
by building energy equity and resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair <eol> and impartial # <eob> access to energy that is clean, <eol> reliable and # affordable. <eol>
At scale, xxxxxxxxx technology, <eob> clean xxxxxxxxxx and energy efficiency <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eol>
And # for xxxx xxxx energy # burdens, <eol> it can help them xxxxxxx <eol> 20 percent their income # xx <eol> 20 percent <eob> of # person's # <eob> income who's to <eob> make ends <eol> meet. <eob>
This <eol> is life-changing. <eob>
This is an # opportunity for xxxxxxxx to <eol> # use their energy # xxxxxxx <eol> to # sponsor their xxxxxxx <eol>
I think xxxx <eob> to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, impossible choices <eob> that they had # to make <eol> xxx xxx effect # it had <eol> xx our whole community. <eol>
But this <eob> is not just about xxxxx <eob>
There are millions nationwide having <eob> to make the same impossible today. <eob>
xxx I # know high # burdens <eol> are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier <eol> to overcome, <eol> but through # <eob> with communities <eol> and technology, we xxxx paths xx xxxxxxxx them. <eob>
And <eob> when we do, <eol> we will all be # more resilient.
Thank you.
<eol>
Have you xxxx watched <eol> a <eob> of birds work # together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, in perfect # synchrony: <eob> xxxxx it fascinating? <eol>
What I find remarkable is that birds <eol> would xxx be <eob> able xx do # <eob> if they all xxxxx # have <eol> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed <eol> would simply be too # low. <eol>
Instead, scientists <eob> believe <eol> that these birds are aligned <eob> a few # rules, <eol> allowing every # bird <eol> to # make autonomous # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx still flying in perfect <eob> synchrony.
alignment enables their <eob> and # their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, # what does this have to do <eob> with one of <eob> xxx <eol>
Well, it's <eol> # one xxx of xxxxxxxxxxxx what I xxxxxxx # to the most <eol> important xxxxxx <eol> is # <eol> needed <eol> in ways <eob> of working today. <eol>
The xx getting faster and more so xx need x new xxx of <eol> working, way that creates xxxxxxxxx around xxxxxxxx <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and <eob> that <eol> truly # empowers people <eol> to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the xxxxxxxx is: In order to get there, what <eob> are we willing # xx give <eob>
A <eol> few # years ago, # I # was # <eob> working <eob> with a <eol> that to embark # a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to be # simpler, <eol> more intuitive, more # relevant.
sure how many you <eol> xxxx seen # a # bank from the <eol> so let <eob> me try # to <eob> illustrate <eol> what traditional banks look xxxxx <eob>
xxx see # lots of people # in suits taking elevators xx go to their department, <eol> marketers sitting xxxx # marketers, engineers with # engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings <eob> with # 20 people <eob> nothing # gets # decided.
Great ideas? They up in PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
there are endless handovers <eol> departments. <eob>
Getting anything <eol> done can take forever. <eol>
So xxxx bank knew <eol> that # in xxxxx to transform, <eob> they would to # improve <eol> their time # to market <eob> by drastically changing <eob> their # working <eob> xx well.
But how?
get some we decided <eob> to # go and have a look xxxxxxxxx <eol> that xxxx to be innovative, <eol> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember how xx were <eol> walking <eol> the halls <eob> at one # <eol> these <eol> # <eob> December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx consultant <eol> and a team of bankers. <eob>
We felt # like # strangers # in a strange land, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx by beanbags and hoodies <eol> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we xxxxxx <eol> xxxx is <eob> your # <eob> organized?" <eob> And we expected to get an xxx # chart. <eob>
But xxxxxxxx they <eob> xxxx strange <eol> # drawings <eol> with <eob> funny xxxxx # like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" and # xxxxxxxx <eob> to explain how # they # were organized. <eob>
So <eob> then xx # to # translate <eol> that to our own world.
We asked, xxxx <eob> many <eob> people <eol> are for you?" <eob> "It
"Who <eob> do you to?" <eol> "It depends". <eol>
"Who decides on # your priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You can <eob> imagine our surprise. <eol>
We were asking for xxxx we thought <eol> were # <eob> of basic <eob> principles <eol> <eob> and their was, "It depends".
Now, the course of that we gained better <eol> # their model.
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like <eol>
They had product <eol> people <eol> and IT engineers in xxx same team <eob> so they could # design, build and test ideas with customers <eob> independently xx others in the company. <eob>
# not need handovers <eob> between departments.
They had all the needed <eob> xxxxx there in the team. <eol>
Now, at the end <eob> of # that had a session to reflect # on what we had learned.
And we had started to like # their model, so we were thinking of how <eol> to apply some # of these ideas # to x <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> guy who xxx xxx said a word all day, <eob> he xxxxxxxx "So I see you our model. <eob>
But I have one question # xxx you: <eol> What are you willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give xxx <eob>
did # not have an answer immediately, <eol> but we knew # he <eol> xxx right. <eol>
Change # is not # only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> about giving up on <eol> some of the old well.
Now, over # the past five years, <eob> have xxxxxx with companies <eol> xxx over the world <eob> to xxxxxx their # ways of working. <eob>
And xxxxxxxx # xxxxx company has their skeptics <eob> about why this is xxx <eob> going # work for # them.
"Our product is more complex," <eol> or # "They don't have <eol> the legacy IT like we do," <eol> or "Regulators just won't # xxxx <eol> in our industry". <eol>
xxx for xxxx and also <eol> for xxx other companies <eol> that <eob> I xxxx worked with <eol> change xxx <eob>
a year, we completely <eol> blew up # the old silos <eol> between marketing, product, channels and IT. <eob>
Three # thousand employees xxxx reorganized xxxx 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So of xxxxxxx people <eob> xxxxxxx xxxx # with <eob> product people <eob> xxx xxxxxxxxx with engineers, x person and an engineer were now members # <eob> of <eob> the same team. <eob>
You # could be x member of a team <eol> responsible # for account opening <eob> or <eob> xxx the <eob> mobile # banking app,
At the xxxxxxx date <eol> of that new organization, some # people shaking xxxxx <eol> for the very first time, only <eob> xx find out that # they had # been sitting two minutes # <eob> xxxx from other <eob> but they were # sending each other emails and status reports for xxx last 10 years.
You <eob> hear someone # saying, "Ah, so xxxxxx xxx guy xxxx I <eol> was always chasing for answers". xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx <eol> coffee together # xxxxx day.
If the product guy has # an idea, he can just raise <eol> # it <eob> get input from the engineer who # is sitting right # next xx him. <eob>
They can to <eob> # test <eol> with # customers immediately -- <eob> no # no PowerPoints, no red # tape, just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, # getting there is not easy. <eol>
as it xxxxx out, <eob> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> exactly the right # question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eol>
Instead of decisions going <eol> up # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> we want the team to decide. <eob>
But to # do so, we need all # the xxxxxx <eob> xxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx for that decision <eol> xx the team. <eob>
And this xxxxxx difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically co-locate our people xxx # are in different buildings, <eol> different cities # or even <eol> countries today?
Or should xx xxxxxx <eol> in xxxxxx videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency in the way we do # things <eol> across <eob> these teams?
We still <eol> need some kind <eob> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all changes to structure and # process and procedure -- <eob> they are xxx easy.
But xx the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing to <eob> change is our own <eob>
Let try xx illustrate. <eob>
If we <eol> want these teams be fast, flexible, creative, # like # mini-start-up, <eob> they # have # to be xxxxxxxxx and autonomous. <eob>
But this means we cannot # have leaders <eob> commanding their xxxxxx what to do, when to do, how <eob> to <eob> do.
No micromanagers. <eol>
But it <eol> also means xxxx # each employee needs to become a leader, <eol> regardless of # their formal title.
It's about all of us stepping to # initiative.
Now xxxxxxxxxx we also cannot <eol> to have all these # teams running # in xxxxxxxxx # directions, <eob> because <eob> that would <eol> xxxxxxxxx lead xx chaos.
So we need alignment # <eob> autonomy <eol> at the same xxxxx <eol> just a of birds. <eob>
In xx organizational <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> this <eob> requires new behaviors, <eol> xxxx <eol> each new # behavior, <eob> there is # giving up <eol> xx something xxx as well. <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eob> that xxxxxxxx in the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx aligned around <eol> the overall # purpose -- the why -- <eol> and <eob> the overall -- the <eol> what. <eol>
But then # they have to # go and trust xxxxx to # make the right decisions <eol> on how to <eob> get # <eob> there.
Now, creating <eol> alignment requires open and transparent communication. <eol>
But # you # know how they say information is a source of power? <eol>
Well, for some # managers, <eol> sharing may # feel if <eol> xxxxxx up that source <eob> of power.
And it's not just xxxxxxxxx <eol>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly and # transparently as well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx teams <eol> typically work in short sprints, <eob> and the end # of every <eob> they # organize <eob> # a demo session <eob> to share xxx output <eol> of what they've done, # transparently. <eol>
xxxxx day, <eol> xxxx member of <eob> gives an xxxxxx <eol> of what they are working individually.
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be <eob> uncomfortable xxx because suddenly, there is place <eob> to hide <eob> anymore. <eol>
Everything <eob> we do <eob> is <eob> # transparent for # <eob> everyone. <eol>
So, alignment xx not easy, xxx autonomy is <eol> not so xxxxxxxx # <eob> either.
One executive at another # company <eol> likes <eob> xx explain how he used <eob> to xx <eol> a # of <eob>
Now, today, # know how things are going, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx at reports, <eob> he # needs walk down to the team floors <eol> to # attend xxx xxxxx sessions.
And instead of xxxxxxx people # what # to xxx <eob> # # ways to # <eob> help them. <eol>
That # <eob> is <eob> xxxxxxx change <eob> xxx someone # xxx # xxxx to be <eol> a <eol> of # milestone-tracking.
But in # # old world, # this xxxxxxxxx # said, <eob> "I # had the # control. <eol>
xx reality, projects xxxxx run <eol> over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
Now I have much transparency, <eob> xxx I xxx course-correct <eob> much earlier <eob> # if needed". <eol>
xxx middle <eob> need to change <eol> as well.
First # of xxxx the xxxxxxxxx and the PowerPoint, <eob> xxxxxxx less # of a xxxx for middle xxxxxxxxx
And in the there was <eol> this idea xx # thinkers and # doers. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx would # xxxx follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead # only managing other people, <eob> middle managers were expected <eol> to # become player-coaches. <eol>
So imagine, for last 10 xxxxxx <eob> you have just <eob> been xxxxxxx <eol> # <eob> people <eob> what to do, <eob> but <eob> now you're expected <eol> xx xx things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
Clearly, xxxx is xxx for xxxxxxxxx and some great people the <eob>
But the result a xxx <eob> with # less xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
And all # of # this # hard xxxxx <eob>
it's <eob> worth it. <eol>
xxx xxxxxxxxx that I worked with, they <eob> were used <eol> new product features # <eol> a xxx # times per year. <eob>
Now they every few # weeks, xxx without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eob> the whole organization <eob> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if # you the xxxxx <eol> of these companies <eol> today, <eol> you just # feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels if # <eol> you're walking <eol> the halls # of a very large xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eob> xxxx cannot # claim xxxxxxx xxxx <eol>
But at least <eol> with this new xxxxxx <eol> they are # much better prepared <eol> to respond to <eob> change.
The is getting faster xxx more <eob> so xx need to reboot our way of working. <eob>
And the hardest part of # change <eob> is not # in structure <eob> or process or procedure, <eol> and it's xxxx # not just senior xxxxxxxxxx taking charge.
Leaders will # be all # xx the organization <eob> who <eob> embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead the change.
So the question # is: <eob> What are you to # <eob> give up? <eol>
xxxxx you.

Never let 'em see you sweat, <eol> xxxxxx have an answer.

It # was conscious choice <eob> from # xxx xxxx <eob> beginning. <eol>
Notice I don't use the word # <eob> because sets up # the expectation, that # some xxxxxx are essential <eob> and some aren't.
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eol> where everyone is xx # <eob> an equal playing field. <eol>
I think a distributed workforce <eol> is # the most effective xxx <eob> to build a
The key is you have # xx <eob> it consciously. <eob>
xxxx xx WordPress, many of xxx 20 <eol> hires <eob> people I'd xxxxx met in person. <eob>
But collaborated # online, sometimes # for years.
I wanted <eob> xx continue <eol> xxx one simple reason. <eob>
x believe talent <eol> and intelligence <eol> are equally distributed <eol> throughout the world. <eol> But xxxxxxxxxxx is xxxx <eob>
In # Silicon # xxxxxxx <eol> big tech # companies # from essentially <eob> the xxxx small # pond or bay. <eob>
A distributed company <eol> can fish # xxxx the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring <eob> someone # who grew up <eol> xx Japan but lives # in California, xxx can # gain someone <eol> who lives, works, <eol> wakes up and goes <eol> to # sleep <eol> wherever they are in <eol> the <eob> bring a different <eol> understanding of xxxx xxxxxxx <eol> and a # different # lived experience. <eob>
At # <eob> the base of the # decision <eol> to go distributed, <eob> there's xxxxxx to people autonomy <eob> they do <eob> # their work. <eol>
Unless <eob> # # in a role <eob> where # specific are xxxxxxxxxx <eol> you can # make <eob> your own schedule. <eol>
Everyone can # have a # corner office, <eob> their windows, the food they <eol> xxxx to <eob> eat, <eob> you can choose there's xxxxx and when there's silence. <eol>
You can choose what temperature <eol> the room should be.
You <eol> save <eob> xxx time <eol> xxxxx spend commuting <eob> xxx put xx into things <eob> that are important to # you. <eob>
A <eol> # distributed workforce <eol> is a technology company.
But <eol> people # xxxxx ask me, "This works # great <eob> for y'all, <eol> but xxxx about everyone <eol> else?" If <eob> have # office, <eob> you xxx a # few things <eob> to # build distributed # capability.
First: <eob> # document everything.
an office, easy to make decisions # the moment, <eol> in the kitchen, in <eob>
But if people # <eol> work remotely <eol> and some <eob> of <eob> are having those conversations <eol> they <eob> don't # have access to, <eol> see these decisions being <eob> made without understanding why.
Always leave a trail of where you were and what you were thinking about. <eol>
This to <eob> pick up where you xxxx off.
xx <eol> allows people in # different <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great xx think about <eob> as an organization evolves, <eob> xxxxxx and # <eol> joining.
Try to # have # <eob> xx much communication as possible online. <eob>
xxxx everything's and <eol> xxxxxxx <eol> it allows new people to # catch quickly. <eob>
You also # xxxx to find the right
There are # so many apps and # services <eol> that help xxxx day-to-day # video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # changed how # you <eob> probably aren't <eol> objects xxxxxxxx
They're # things you access your computer. <eol>
So # <eol> with <eol> tools that enable collaboration, see what works. <eob>
# productive, face-to-face time. <eob>
In a traditional # office, xxxxxx in the same place <eob> 48 weeks out xx the year and you might have <eol> three or four weeks apart.
We try to flip that: we come xxxxxxxx <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once x year we do a <eob> grand meet-up <eol> where the # entire company <eob> comes xxxxxxxx # for a xxxxx
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary <eol> goal is connecting <eol> people. <eol> xx xx xxxx sure everyone's aligned and on same # <eob> and they <eob> have a xxxxxx # connection <eol> with their colleagues. <eob>
When they work # together <eol> the rest <eol> of <eob> # the xxxxx <eob> xxxx <eol> can bring # together <eob> # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work environment. <eol>
Every # person # at Automattic <eob> has a co-working stipend <eob> that # towards a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eol> or <eob> just to buy coffee, so they don't <eol> get kicked xxx # <eob> of the coffee <eob> shop. <eol>
One xxxxx in Seattle <eob> to <eol> pool their stipends together <eob> and rented a xxxxxxxxx # fishing pier.
Each joins # xxx company <eol> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This they can <eob> invest <eob> in getting # the right chair, xxxxxxxx <eob> the right desk setup, so can have <eob> the # productive environment xxx them. <eol>
Today, # there are # just a few # companies <eol> that distributed # first. <eol>
In a decade <eob> or # two, <eol> I that percent companies <eob> that # are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eob> xxx going to function # way. <eob>
will <eol> xxxxxx to distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by xxxxx are.
xx you think xxxxx what you're to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eol> into global talent, give <eob> # people xx # live and work <eob> where they # they should <eob> and still participate fully in whatever <eob> it xx that you're creating xxxxxxxxx <eob>
