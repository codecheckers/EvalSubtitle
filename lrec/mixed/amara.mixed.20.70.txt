Imagine waking up <eob> a stranger -- <eob> sometimes multiple strangers <eob> questioning your right to existence <eol> for something that you online, <eol> waking up to # an angry message, scared and worried for <eob> your safety.
Welcome <eol> # to the world of cyberharassment.
The # kind of xxxxxxxxxx that women face xx Pakistan is very serious <eob> and # to sometimes deadly <eob>
This xxxx of harassment keeps <eob> women <eol> from accessing xxx internet -- <eob> essentially, knowledge. <eob>
It's a form of oppression. <eob>
is xxx sixth most populous <eol> country the world, <eol> xxxx 140 million xxxxxx having access <eol> to technologies, <eob> and 15 percent xxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx number doesn't xxxx # go down with xxx rise new technologies. <eob>
Pakistan <eol> is # also the birthplace <eol> of xxx youngest Nobel Peace # xxxxx winner, <eob> Malala Yousafzai. <eob>
But that's just one # xxxxxx of Pakistan. <eob>
xxxxxxx aspect is # where <eob> the <eob> twisted concept of honor is linked # to women and # their bodies; <eol> where # men are allowed to disrespect women <eol> even kill them sometimes <eob> the name so-called "family honor"; where xxxxx <eol> # are left # <eob> to die <eol> right outside their houses for speaking xx a man on a mobile phone, in # the of xxxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob>
Let me say this very clearly: <eob> it's # xxx honor; <eob> it's a cold-blooded murder. <eol>
I come from a small village <eob> in # Punjab, Pakistan, where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education. <eol>
The # elders of # my family <eob> allow women <eob> to pursue # their higher education or xxxxx careers. <eob>
However, unlike the <eob> other male guardians of my family, my father # was # one <eob> who really supported my ambitions. <eob>
To get my law <eob> degree, <eob> of course, # it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of <eob>
But in xxx end, I knew <eob> it's either me xx them, <eol> chose myself.
(Applause) <eob>
My xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and <eob> for a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to own x mobile <eob> until x was married.
And even I was married, <eob> this tool # became a tool <eob> for my xxx surveillance.
xxxx <eob> I resisted this idea <eol> of surveilled my ex-husband, <eol> he really didn't approve # of this and threw me # out of # his house, along with my six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eol>
And that <eob> was # the time <eol> when I first asked myself, "Why? <eol>
are women not # allowed <eob> to enjoy <eol> the same equal rights <eob> enshrined in our # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
While the law states x xxxxx <eol> has # the same equal <eol> to the # information, <eob> why is it always men -- # brothers, fathers and husbands <eob> who are granting these rights to us, <eol> effectively making the law irrelevant?" <eol>
So to take # a step, instead of <eob> # keep questioning <eob> these patriarchal <eol> and societal norms. <eob>
And I the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012 <eob> to the issues <eob> and # women's experiences in online spaces <eol> and <eob> # cyberharassment. <eob>
lobbying xxx free and safe internet <eob> xx convincing young women <eob> that to the safe xxxxxxxx <eol> is their fundamental, basic, human # <eob> I'm trying # to play my part <eob> in igniting # the spark <eob> to address # <eob> the questions that have bothered me all these years. <eol>
With a xxxx in my heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's and <eol> the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in <eob> December xxxx -- <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to extend my support to # the women <eol> who do xxx know who to turn to <eob> when they xxxx <eol> xxxxxxx threats online. <eol>
I think of the women # who do not # have <eol> the necessary support <eol> to # deal with the mental trauma <eol> when they # feel unsafe in online spaces, <eob> and they go about daily <eob> xxxxxxxx that is <eol> x rape threat <eol> in their in-box. <eob>

(Applause) <eob>
at # critical moment. <eob>
Our leaders, <eol> of our great xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx # failing <eob>
Why? <eol>
In # some cases, <eob> # it's because # they're bad <eob> or unethical, <eol> but often, they've taken us <eol> to the wrong objectives. <eob>
And this # is unacceptable. <eol>
This has <eol> to <eob>
How are going to correct these wrongs? <eob>
xxx are we # xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the right course? <eob>
It's not going to be easy.
For I've worked with talented teams <eol> and they've # chosen the right <eol> objectives and xxx wrong objectives. <eob>
Many <eol> have succeeded, <eob> others of # them have
And today # # <eob> to <eob> share with <eol> xxx <eob> what # <eol> really makes x xxxxxxxxxx -- that's <eob> what's crucial, <eol> how xxx why <eol> they set meaningful and audacious goals, <eob> the right # goals for the right reasons. <eol>
Let's go back to # 1975. <eob>
Yep, this <eob> # # me.
I've got a xxx to learn, I'm a <eol> computer engineer, I've got long # hair, <eob> but # I'm # working under Andy Grove, <eob> who's been called the # greatest manager <eol> of his or any # other era. <eob>
Andy <eob> was # a superb <eob> and also a teacher, <eob> and he said # to me, "John, <eol> it almost # doesn't matter xxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxxxx what matters the most". <eob>
And so Andy # a system called "Objectives and xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx # kind of rolls off <eol> xxx tongue, doesn't <eol> it?
xxx it's all about excellent
So a classic video from the 1970s <eol> of Andy xxxxxx <eol>
(Video) Andy # Grove: The two key # phrases <eob> management by objective systems <eob> are the <eob> # objectives and the key results, and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is the xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx key results have to be measured, <eob> but at the <eol> end you can # look <eob> and without any xxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> "Did do # xxxxx # or did I <eol> not that?" <eol> No. <eob> Simple. <eob>
John Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx and xxx Results, <eol> or OKRs, are a # simple goal-setting <eol> xxxxxx <eob> and they # work for organizations, <eol> they work teams, they even work for individuals.
are what <eol> want to have accomplished. <eol>
key results are how <eob> I'm going xx get that done.
Objectives. Key <eol> results. <eob>
What and how. <eol>
But here's the truth: xxxx of us are goals wrong, <eob> and most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all.
A lot of organizations <eol> set objectives and <eob> # meet them. <eob>
They ship their sales, <eol> they <eob> introduce their new products, <eob> xxxx make their numbers, <eob> but <eob> they lack a sense of purpose <eob> to xxxxxxx their teams.
So # <eol> xxx do you set <eol> these goals the xxxxx way? <eob>
First, must answer <eol> the # "Why?" <eob> <eol>
Because <eob> truly transformational teams <eob> combine xxxxx <eol> ambitions <eol> to their # <eob> passion and to their # purpose, <eol> they develop a clear <eol> and compelling # sense of why. <eob>
x want to tell you # a story. <eol>
I work with a remarkable <eob> entrepreneur. <eol>
Her name is Jini Kim. <eol>
She runs a <eol> company called Nuna. <eol>
is # health care data company.
And when Nuna was founded, <eob> they xxxx data # to serve the health needs <eol> of lots of workers # at large companies. <eol>
And then two years <eob> into the company's life, <eob> the government issued a proposal <eob> to build the xxxxx ever cloud database <eob> for Medicaid. <eob>
Now, you'll # that Medicaid is that # program that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our # xxxxx our children <eol> and people with disabilities.
Nuna the time was # just 15 people <eob> and this database <eol> had to be built in <eol> one year, <eol> and # they had a set of commitments <eol> xxxx they xxx to honor, <eol> and frankly, they weren't going to make <eol> very much money xx the project.
xxxx xxx a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She did not flinch. <eob>
Why?
Well, it's a personal why. <eob>
Jini's younger brother # Kimong has autism. <eol>
And <eob> he was seven, <eob> he had his # <eol> xxxxx grand mal seizure <eol> at Disneyland.
He fell to the ground. <eob> He stopped breathing. <eob>
Jini's parents Korean # immigrants. <eob>
They <eob> came # to the # country xxxx limited resources <eob> speaking little English, <eob> so it was up to Jini <eol> to enroll her family xx Medicaid. <eob>
xxx # was nine # years old. <eob>
That moment <eob> defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her company, <eob> xxx <eob> that company bid on, won <eol> and delivered on that xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxx Jini to tell you why. <eol>
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid <eob> saved my family from bankruptcy, and # today it provides for Kimong's health and for millions others. <eob>
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.
Every row of xxxx # a <eob> life whose story deserves <eol> with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's <eol> story tells us that a compelling sense <eol> of why can be the launchpad for our objectives. <eol>
Remember, what <eol> we want to have accomplished. <eob>
And objectives are # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxx are inspiring, and they're kind of xxxxxxx <eob> against <eob> fuzzy thinking. <eol>
You think # a rockstar would be unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key Results, <eob> but xxx years, Bono has OKRs <eob> to wage a global xxx against poverty # <eob> and xxxxxxxx <eol> and his ONE organization has xxxxxxx on two really xxxxxxxxx <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The # is xxxx relief <eob> for the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eob>
The next xxxxxxxxx access <eob> anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, why are these good <eob>
xxxxx xx back <eol> to # our checklist.
Check. # Concrete? Yes. <eol>
Action-oriented? Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eob>
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?
How passionate?
What actions does # your passion <eol> lead xxx to do? <eob>
If the heart doesn't find a rhyme # with the # head, <eob> then <eob> your passion means nothing. <eob>
# OKR framework cultivates the <eob> madness, <eob> the chemistry contained xxxxxx xxx
It gives us an xxxxxxxxxxx for risk, <eol> for trust, where failing not a fireable offense.
And <eob> when you have that sort xx structure and environment <eob> and the right people, <eob> magic # xx around the corner. <eob>
JD: <eob> I xxxx that. <eob>
OKRs xxx xxxxxxxx and magic is right around the # corner. <eol>
This is perfect.
So with Jini we've covered xxx whys, <eob> xxxx Bono the # whats # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn <eob> # attention <eob> the xxxxx <eob>
Remember, the hows the key results. <eob> That's <eob> how we meet our objectives. <eob>
And good <eob> results <eol> are specific and time-bound. <eob>
They're <eob> aggressive but xxxxxxxxxx
They're measurable, <eol> and they're verifiable. <eol>
Those are good key results. <eob>
In 1999, I introduced OKRs <eob> to Google's cofounders, <eob> Larry # and Sergey.
Here they <eol> 24 years old in their garage. <eob>
And Sergey <eob> enthusiastically said he'd adopt them. <eob>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
What he really <eol> # said was, <eob> "We any other to manage this company, <eol> so it a go". (Laughter) <eol>
And # I # took xxxx as x kind of endorsement. <eob>
But every quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written down <eob> her objectives and her key
They've graded them, <eol> and they've xxxxxxxxx # them <eob> for everyone to <eob>
And these are <eol> not used <eol> for bonuses or for xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # set aside.
They're for a higher purpose, <eob> and that's # get xxxxxxxxxx commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eob>
In 2008, a Googler, <eob> Sundar Pichai, <eol> took on an objective <eob> which was to build <eol> the <eob> xxxx generation client platform <eob> for the future of web # xxxxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> in other words, build xxx browser.
He was very xxxxxxxxxx <eol> about how # he chose his key results. <eol>
How do you xxxxxxx the best browser?
It could be ad clicks or engagement. <eob>
No. <eol> He said: numbers of xxxxxxx users are going # to decide <eol> if Chrome is a great xxxxxxx xx not.
So he this # one <eob> three-year-long <eob> objective: <eol> build the best <eob> browser. <eob>
And then <eob> every year <eol> he stuck to <eob> the same key results, <eob> numbers of users, but the ante. <eob>
In first year, <eol> his <eob> # was 20 million <eob> users <eol> and he missed it. <eob>
He less xxxx 10.
Second <eol> year, he raised <eol> the bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got to 37 million <eol> users.
xxxxxxxx better. <eob>
In the # third year, <eol> he upped <eob> the ante once xxxx <eol> to # a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He # launched an xxxxxxxxxx <eob> marketing <eol> campaign, broader distribution, <eol> improved xxx technology, and kaboom! <eol>
He got 111 # million users. <eob>
Here's why I like this <eob> # story, xxx <eol> so much for the happy but it someone <eob> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and then sticking to it <eol> year after year after year.
It's x perfect story for nerd me. <eob>
Now, I think of <eob> OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> that are made <eob> from the whats and hows of our ambitions. <eol>
really matters is # the xxx that xx pour xxxx those vessels. <eob>
That's why we do our work. <eol>
are x silver # bullet. <eol>
They're not going to # a substitute a strong culture <eol> or for leadership, but # when those # fundamentals are # in place, <eol> they # can take you to the mountaintop. <eol>
I # want you # to # think <eol> about your life for a moment. <eob>
Do you # have the right metrics?
Take time to write # down your values, <eob> your objectives and your key results. <eol>
xx it today.
If # like some feedback on them, <eol> you # can send them to me.
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eol>
If we think of the world-changing goals <eob> of an Intel, of a Nuna, of xxxxx <eob> of Google, <eob> they're remarkable: <eol> ubiquitous xxxxxxxxxx affordable health care, <eol> high-quality for # everyone, <eob> ending global poverty, <eol> access to xxx the world's information. <eob>
Here's <eol> the deal: <eob> every one of those goals <eol> is powered xxxxx by OKRs. <eol>
Now, I've been called <eol> the xxxxxx Appleseed of OKRs <eol> for spreading good gospel <eol> according # to Andy xxxxxx <eob> but I <eob> want you to join xx # in this # movement. <eol>
Let's fight what it is <eob> xxxx really # matters, <eob> because we can # take OKRs beyond our businesses. <eob>
# can take <eob> them to our families, <eol> to our schools, even to # our governments. <eob>
We can xxxx those # governments <eob> accountable.
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can # get back on the right track if we can and do measure <eol> what really <eob> matters. <eob>
Thank <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
What is history?
It is something written by the winners. <eol>
is a stereotype that history <eol> should be focused on the rulers, <eob> like Lenin or Trotsky. <eob>
As a result, people <eol> in countries, like mine, Russia, <eob> look at as something that was <eob> or determined xx leaders, <eob> and common people could xxx <eol> influence it in any way. <eol>
Many Russians today do not believe <eol> that xxxxxx could ever xxxx been <eob> or <eob> ever will xx a # truly democratic nation, <eob> and xxxx is xxx to the way <eob> history has xxxx framed to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And <eol> this is true. <eob>
To prove it, I spent two # <eol> of my life trying to go 100 years back, <eob> to the year 1917, <eob> the year xx the Russian Revolution. <eob>
x asked myself, what <eob> if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
So last year, we built <eol> a # social network xxx dead people, <eol> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My # team and I created our software, <eob> digitized and uploaded <eob> all possible real diaries and letters <eob> written by more than 3,000 people 100 <eol> # years ago. <eol>
So any user of our <eol> website # xx application <eob> follow a feed <eol> xxx each day of 1917 <eob> and read what people <eob> like # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> Trotsky, <eol> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and <eob> others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities <eol> being ordinary people like # <eob> you xxx <eob> me, not <eol> # demigods, <eob> and we see that history consists <eob> of their xxxxxxxxx # fears, weaknesses, <eob> not xxxx their "genius ideas". <eob>
xxx project was x shock for many xxxxxxxxx who used to think that our country <eob> has always been an autocratic empire and the ideas <eob> of freedom and democracy <eol> could never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy xxx xxx our destiny. <eob>
But we take a broader look, it's not that <eob> black and white. <eob>
1917 # led to 70 years of communist dictatorship.
But xxxx this # project, we see # that Russia could # have had a different history <eob> and a # xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as # any other <eob> country could or still can. <eob>
Reading the posts xxxx 1917, <eob> you learn that xxxxxx <eol> was first country <eob> in the world to abolish the death penalty, <eob> or one the first ones <eol> to grant women <eob> voting rights.
Knowing <eol> # history and understanding <eol> xxx # ordinary people influenced xxxxxxx <eob> can help # us create a future, <eob> because history is xxxx a rehearsal of <eob> what's # xxxxxxxxx xxxxx now. <eob>
We do need new ways of telling history, <eob> and this xxxxx for example, <eol> we started a # xxx online project that called 1968Digital.com, <eol> and that is an online documentary that gives <eol> you an impression <eob> of that xxxxx <eob> a year marked by global social change <eol> that, many ways, xxxxxxx the world as know it now.
But we are making xxxx history <eob> by imagining what if all <eol> # the main <eol> could use mobile <eob> phones # ... <eob> just like that? <eol>
And we see that x lot of xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> were xxxxxx the same challenges <eol> and were fighting the same values, <eob> no matter if they lived in the US or in USSR <eol> or France or in China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eol> in such a democratic way, <eob> through # social media, <eob> we show that people xx power <eob> are <eol> not the only ones # making # xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives # any user a <eob> possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
people matter. <eol>
They have an impact. <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
Journalists, scientists, <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx # matter. <eol>
We shape <eol>
We all make history. <eol>
you. <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
algorithms today <eol> are performing incredible tasks <eob> with high accuracies, at a massive <eob> scale, <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence.
And this xxxxxxxxxxxx of # computers <eob> is often referred to <eol> xx <eob> AI <eol> or artificial # intelligence. <eob>
xx is poised to make xx incredible xxxxxx <eol> on our lives in the # future. <eob>
Today, # however, <eol> we still xxxx massive xxxxxxxxxx <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eob> several <eob> # <eob> life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as infectious <eob> diseases xxx cancer. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx of every <eob> lose their # lives <eob> due to liver and # oral cancer. <eol>
Our xxxx way xx help these patients <eob> is to perform early detection <eob> and diagnoses of xxxxx diseases.
So how xx we these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial intelligence help?
In patients who, unfortunately, <eob> are suspected xxxxx diseases, <eol> an expert physician xxxxx # orders <eol> very expensive <eol> medical xxxxxxx <eob> technologies <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxxx imaging, CTs, MRIs, # to be performed. <eob>
Once those images are <eob> # collected, <eob> another # expert physician then diagnoses <eol> those images and talks to <eol> the patient. <eol>
As you can see, this is <eol> a very process, <eob> requiring both expert physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, <eol> and is considered practical <eol> for the # developing world. <eob>
in fact, xx many <eol> industrialized nations, as well. <eob>
So, can # we this <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eol>
Today, if # I were to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures to solve this problem, <eol> I would require 10,000 -- <eob> I repeat, on an order of 10,000 <eol> these very expensive medical # <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I would <eob> then # <eob> # an # expert physician, <eol> who would then analyze <eob> those images for <eol>
And <eob> # using those two pieces xx information, <eol> I can train a standard deep neural network xx deep learning network <eob> to provide patient's # diagnosis. <eob>
Similar to the xxxxx approach, traditional # intelligence approaches <eob> suffer from the <eob> same problem.
Large # amounts <eob> of data, expert physicians <eol> xxx # expert medical imaging technologies. <eol>
So, can we invent more scalable, # effective <eob> and xxxx <eol> xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> intelligence architectures to solve these very <eob> problems facing today?
And this is exactly <eol> what my group at MIT Media xxx does. <eob>
We have invented # <eol> a variety of unorthodox # <eob> AI <eob> architectures to solve some of the most # important <eol> challenges facing us today <eob> in medical imaging and clinical # trials. <eol>
In # the example I shared <eol> with you today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our first goal was to reduce xxx number of images <eol> required to train artificial intelligence algorithms. <eob>
xxx xxxxxx goal -- we xxxx # more ambitious, xx wanted to reduce the use of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen patients.
So how we # do <eol> it? <eol>
For <eob> our <eob> first <eol> goal, <eob> instead of starting <eol> tens and thousands <eob> of these very # expensive images, like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started a single medical image. <eob>
From this # image, my team and x <eol> figured out a very clever way <eob> to extract billions <eob> of information # packets.
These information xxxxxxx <eol> included <eol> xxxxxxx pixels, geometry and rendering xx the disease <eob> xx the medical image. <eob>
In x sense, we <eob> converted # one <eob> into billions of training data points, <eob> massively reducing the # amount of data <eol> needed xxx training.
For our <eob> second xxxxx <eob> to xxxxxx the use expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients, we started with a standard, <eob> white light photograph, <eol> acquired either from x DSLR camera <eob> xx a mobile phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eob> billions of information <eob> # packets?
We overlaid those from <eol> xxx medical image onto this <eob> creating something <eol> that we call <eob> a composite image. <eol>
Much to our we only required 50 -- I repeat, # xxxx # 50 # -- <eob> of composite images to train <eol> xxxxxxxxxx to high efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize xxx approach, instead of using <eob> very expensive medical # images, <eob> now train the AI in an # unorthodox way, using # only # 50 of these <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> but standard photographs, <eol> acquired from DSLR cameras xxx xxxxxx phones, <eol> and provide diagnosis. <eol>
More importantly, <eob> our algorithms can # <eob> accept, <eob> in the future and even right now, some # very simple, # white light <eol> photographs <eob> from patient, <eob> of # expensive <eob> medical imaging # xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
I believe that we are # poised to enter an # <eob> where artificial # intelligence <eol> is to make <eob> an xxxxxxxxxx <eol> impact # on our xxxxxxx
I think that xxxxxxxx about traditional AI, <eol> which data-rich but application-poor, xx should also continue # thinking <eol> about unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence architectures, <eob> which can accept <eol> # small xxxxxxx # of data <eob> and solve some of the most important <eol> xxxxxxxx facing us xxxxxx <eob> especially in xxxxxx # care. <eob>
Thank you very <eol> much.

What if could take a <eol> pill or a vaccine <eob> and, like getting # over a cold, <eol> you could your wounds faster? <eob>
Today, xx we have an <eol> operation or # xx accident, we're in the <eol> hospital for weeks, <eob> and often left with scars and painful side effects <eol> of our regenerate <eol> or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. <eol>
I <eob> xxxx to # xxxxxx materials <eob> that instruct our immune system xx give <eol> the signals to grow new tissues. <eol>
like vaccines instruct <eol> our body to fight disease, <eol> we could instead instruct <eol> our immune system to build tissues <eol> and quickly heal <eob> wounds. <eob>
Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere <eob> might seem like magic, <eol> but there are several # organisms <eob> that can achieve this feat.
Some lizards can regrow their tails, <eob> the humble salamander <eol> can completely regenerate their arm, and # even us mere can # regrow our <eol> liver <eob> after losing more than half <eol> of its original mass. <eol>
To make xxxx magic <eol> a bit closer to reality, <eob> I'm investigating how our body <eob> can wounds # and build # <eob> tissue <eob> through instructions <eol> from the immune system. <eob>
From # scrape # on your <eol> to that annoying <eob> xxx <eol> immune system defends <eol> our # body from <eob> danger. <eob>
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I <eol> know <eob> about our body's defense system, <eol> I was able to key players <eob> in our fight to build back xxx cuts and bruises.
xxxx looking at materials <eob> that are currently # being tested <eob> for their abilities to help regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed <eob> that after treating <eol> an <eol> injured xxxx these materials, <eol> xxxxx <eob> was <eob> a large number of immune xxxxx in xxxx material <eol> and the surrounding muscle. <eob>
xx <eob> in this case, instead of xxx immune cells # rushing off <eob> towards infection fight bacteria, they're <eol> rushing toward # an injury. <eob>
I discovered a specific <eob> type of xxxxxx cell, <eob> the helper T cell, was present inside <eol> material that I implanted xxx absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just <eob> like when you were x <eol> kid and <eob> # you'd break your pencil <eob> try # and tape it back together again, <eob> can # <eob> heal, <eob> but # it might not be <eob> # the most functional way, <eob> and we'll xxx a scar. <eol>
So if # we xxxxx have these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops <eob> fat # cells inside of it, <eob> and if there's fat in our # muscle, <eol> xx xxxxx as # strong. <eob>
Now, using our immune system, our body could grow back <eob> without these scars <eob> and look like # what it was <eol> before we were even injured. <eob>
I'm working <eol> to create materials <eob> that give us the signals to build new tissue <eol> xx changing the immune <eob>
We know that any time <eob> a material # implanted in our # body, <eol> the immune system will xxxxxxx to it.
This ranges xxxx pacemakers <eol> to insulin # pumps <eob> to the # materials <eob> # that engineers are using <eol> xx try and new <eob>
xx <eob> when # I xxxxx that material, <eob> or # scaffold, in body, <eob> the immune creates <eol> small environment cells and proteins <eol> that change the xxx that our stem cells behave.
just like the # weather <eol> affects our # daily activities, <eob> like # <eol> going for <eol> a run <eob> or staying and <eol> entire TV show # Netflix, <eob> immune of a scaffold <eol> affects the way that our <eob> stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we have the wrong signals, <eob> say the signals, <eol> we get # fat cells instead of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds # are of a different things, <eob> plastics to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying xxxxxxxxxxxx sponges that are or less porous, <eob> gels of stiffnesses.
researchers <eob> can even make the materials <eol> release different signals time. <eol>
xx other # words, we <eol> can orchestrate <eob> this Broadway show of cells <eob> by giving <eob> them the correct <eol> stage, cues and props <eob> that can be changed # different <eob> just like a <eob> producer would change <eob> the set for "Les Mis" versus <eol> "Little Shop of Horrors".
I'm specific types of signals <eob> that mimic # how our body responds to injury <eol> to <eob> help us regenerate. <eob>
In <eol> # the future, # <eob> we see <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx <eob> a # muscle filler <eol> or even a wound-healing <eob> vaccine.
Now, we aren't going to xxxx up tomorrow and be able xx heal # like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # xxxx these advances, and # working with our immune system <eol> to build tissue and heal wounds, we <eob> could <eob> begin seeing <eol> products on the market <eob> that work with our body's defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one day be able xx keep pace with a salamander. <eob>
Thank you.

as a child, I used spend all of <eob> at my great-grandmother's <eob> house. <eob>
On hot, humid, days, <eol> x would dash xxxxxx # floor <eol> xxx stick my face in # <eob> front of <eol> her only air conditioner. <eob>
But I # didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though # <eob> was a <eol> privileged one <eol> in # <eol> our community.
Growing up, stories of <eol> having to set up fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> xxxxxx normal to me. <eol>
During # the winter, struggling to <eol> get warm, <eol> my neighbors would have no choice <eob> xx bypass the meter <eol> after their heat shut off, <eob> xxxx to keep their family comfortable for one more day.
xxxxx of dangerous <eob> incidents xxx take root <eob> when <eob> people # are faced <eol> with impossible choices. <eob>
In the xxx the average American spends <eol> three percent of <eob> their income on # energy. <eol>
In # contrast, # low-income and <eob> xxxxx # <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx # spend 20, 30 percent <eol> of their income on energy. <eob>
In xxxxx # this caused over <eol> 25 million people to skip meals <eol> to provide # power to their homes. <eob>
This is when energy xxxxxxx a burden. <eol>
But energy burdens <eob> are xx much more <eob> than just a number. <eob>
present impossible <eol> and perilous choices: <eob> Do # you take child <eol> get her flu medicine, <eob> or do you feed her?
Or do you keep warm?
It's an impossible choice, <eob> and <eob> nearly every <eol> month, <eob> seven million people choose <eol> between medicine and energy. <eob>
This exposes a much larger <eol> and # systemic issue.
Families with high # energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, <eol> who spend more per square foot <eol> than their white # <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But nurses, <eol> and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall # into the mass <eol> of xx million people a year who <eob> are unable to afford energy for their most <eob> needs.
As a result, those xxxx <eob> xxxx energy burdens <eob> have <eob> a greater likelihood of conditions <eol> like disease and asthma. <eob>
Look -- # given rockets to <eob> Mars and our pocket-sized # <eol> we have the xxxxx to address <eol> these # systemic inequities. <eob>
The is <eob>
Cost xx renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home <eol> technology <eob> are all decreasing. <eob>
even as we <eol> approach cost xxxxxxx the majority of xxxxx who own solar <eol> earn much more than the average American.
This is why, # when I was 22, <eol> I # the nonprofit RETI. <eob>
Our mission is <eob> to alleviate energy <eol> burdens <eol> by # with # communities, <eob> utilities and # government <eol> agencies alike <eob> to provide equitable access <eol> to clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and energy technology. <eol>
But there's <eol> no one way to solve this. <eob>
I believe the power of local # communities, <eob> in the transforming effect of xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
So start by working directly with the communities <eob> xxxx have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host workshops <eob> and events <eob> for communities <eob> to learn about xxxxxx # poverty, <eol> and making even <eol> small updates to their homes <eol> like better insulation windows and water heaters <eob> can go a long way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting # xx community solar and <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> smart home research <eob> and installation # programs to help families <eol> their # bills. <eob>
We're even <eob> working # <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> with <eob> xxxxxxx officials, <eob> advocating for more equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of energy equity # and resilience succeed, <eob> we xxxx to # work <eol> together sustainably. <eob>
Now, xxx # US spends <eol> over three billion a year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eol>
And these programs do help <eol> millions xx people, <eob> but they're # only able to help <eol> fraction of # those in need. <eob>
In <eob> there is a 47-billion-dollar <eol> home-energy <eol> affordability gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not <eob>
But by building energy equity <eol> and # resilience into our communities, <eob> we can assure fair and impartial access <eol> to that is clean, xxxxxxxx xxx affordable. <eob>
At scale, # microgrid technology, <eob> clean technology and efficiency <eob> dramatically xxxxxxx public health. <eol>
And for xxxxx with xxxx energy burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 # their income -- <eob> 20 percent of a # person's income who's struggling # to make ends meet. <eol>
This <eol> is # life-changing.
This <eob> is an opportunity <eol> xxx families # xx use their # savings <eob> to xxxxxxx their future. <eol>
I think back to my great-grandmother <eob> and xxx neighbors, the impossible <eol> that they # xxx # <eob> to make <eob> and xxx # effect # our whole xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But this <eob> # is not just about # them. <eob>
There # are xxxxxxxx nationwide having <eol> to make the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And I know high energy burdens <eol> xxx a tremendous barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but # through relationships <eob> with communities and <eob> we have the paths to overcome them. <eol>
And when we do, we will # all be more resilient. <eob>

Have ever <eol> a flock of birds <eob> work together? <eol>
Thousands of animals, <eol> flying in perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating?
xxxx I <eob> find remarkable is that these birds <eol> would not be able to do that <eob> if they <eob> # all would have <eol> to follow one leader.
Their reaction # speed <eol> would simply be too low. <eob>
Instead, <eob> scientists believe <eob> that these birds are <eol> aligned on x few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single bird to make autonomous decisions <eol> while still flying in perfect synchrony. <eol>
alignment enables their autonomy, <eob> and their autonomy <eol> xxxxx them xxxx and flexible. <eol>
xxxx what does this have to <eol> do <eol> with any one of # us?
Well, it's one # of xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx <eob> I xxxxxxx to be the most important change <eob> that is needed <eol> in ways of working # today. <eol>
The world getting faster and more complex, so # we need a new way of # xxxxxxxx <eob> a way that <eol> creates <eol> alignment around purpose, <eob> that takes xxx xxxxxxxxxxx and that truly empowers people to make decisions faster. <eob>
the question is: <eob> In order to get there, what are we willing to give xxx <eol>
few years ago, # I was working with a <eob> wanted to embark on a digital xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They # wanted # xxxxx offering to be simpler, intuitive, xxxx relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm not sure how many you have seen a <eob> bank from the # inside, so # let me try to illustrate <eol> xxxx many traditional banks look like. <eob>
You see lots of people in suits <eol> taking elevators to go <eol> to their # department, <eob> marketers # sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with engineers, etc. <eob>
You see meetings <eol> with xx people where nothing gets decided.
Great ideas? They end up <eol> xx PowerPoint xxxxxxx
And there are endless handovers <eol> between departments. <eol>
anything # done xxx take forever.
So this bank knew <eol> that in order to # transform, <eol> they would have to improve <eob> # to market <eol> by drastically xxxxxxxx their ways xx as well.
xxx how? <eob>
To get some <eob> inspiration, we decided <eob> to # go and have a look at # companies <eob> # seem to be more innovative, <eob> xxxx Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I remember # <eob> how we xxxx walking the xxxxx at one of these companies <eol> in December xxxxx <eol> x management consultant <eol> and a xxxx of # bankers. <eol>
felt like strangers xx a strange land, <eol> surrounded # beanbags and hoodies <eol> and lots # of # xxxxxx creative employees. <eob>
So then we asked, <eol> "How is your company organized?" <eob> we <eol> expected xx # get <eob> an org chart. <eol>
But instead, they used strange <eob> drawings funny names like # "squads" and "chapters" and "tribes" <eob> # explain they were organized. <eol>
So then we tried to xxxxxxxxx <eol> that to our # <eol> own world.
We asked, "How people are working for you?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
"Who do you <eob> report to?" <eol> "It <eob> depends". <eol>
"Who decides your priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You can <eol> imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were # asking <eol> # for <eob> what we thought <eol> were some # <eob> of the basic principles <eob> of organizations, <eob> and their answer xxxx <eob> "It depends".
Now, over the course of that xxxx <eob> xx gained a <eob> better <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their <eob> model. <eol>
They believed in # power <eob> of small, teams. <eol>
Their teams were like mini-start-ups. <eob>
xxxx had product people <eol> and # IT engineers in the <eol> same team <eob> so they could design, # build <eol> and test <eob> ideas with <eob> customers <eol> independently of # others in the # company. <eob>
They did <eob> not need handovers xxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx had all the skills needed right there # in the team.
Now, at # the end of that day, <eol> we had a session <eob> to reflect xx what <eob> we had learned. <eob>
And xx had started to like their model, <eob> xx we were already <eol> thinking how <eol> to some of ideas to a # bank.
But xxxxx # <eob> one of the hosts, <eob> a guy who had not said a word <eol> all day, he suddenly said, "So I see <eob> like our # model.
But # I <eob> have one question for you: <eob> What # are willing to give up?" <eob> What <eob> were we willing to give up? <eob>
We did not have xx answer immediately, but we knew he was right. <eol>
xxxxxx <eob> is xxx about <eob> embracing the new; <eob> it's about giving up on some # of the old as # <eob>
Now, over the past five years, <eob> I # have # worked with companies <eob> all over the world to change their xxxx # of working. <eob>
And clearly, every company <eol> xxx their # own skeptics <eob> about why this not <eob> going work # xxx them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," xx "They # have <eol> the # legacy IT like we xxxx <eob> or "Regulators # just won't this <eob> in our industry".
But <eol> for xxxx bank and <eob> also <eol> for the other companies that I worked with afterwards, <eob> change was possible. <eob>
Within a year, we # completely <eol> blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, <eob> xxxxxxxx channels and <eob> IT. <eob>
Three # employees xxxx # <eol> into # 350 teams. <eob>
So instead xx product people <eol> sitting just with product # people <eob> and engineers with engineers, <eob> a # product # person and an engineer <eol> were now members of the same <eob>
You could be a member of a team <eol> responsible <eob> for account opening <eob> or the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the <eob> go-live date <eol> that # new organization, <eob> some people xxxxxxx hands <eob> for the very first <eob> time, <eol> to # find out that they # had been <eob> sitting two # away from each other <eob> but they xxxx sending each # <eol> other emails and status reports for the last 10 # years. <eol>
You would hear someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so you're the guy # that # I was always chasing xxx answers". <eob> <eob>
But they're every day.
xx the product guy xxx an idea, <eol> xx can <eol> just raise <eob> to get input the engineer <eol> xxx <eob> sitting right <eob> next # to # him. <eol>
They can to test <eol> with customers immediately -- <eob> no handovers, no xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> no red xxxxx xxxx getting # xxxxx # done. <eob>
Now, getting there is # not # easy.
xxx # as it turns out, xxxxx are you willing to give up?" is exactly the # right question to ask.
Autonomous decision-making requires multidisciplinary teams.
of decisions <eol> up and down the organization, <eol> we want the team to decide.
But to xx so, we need all the # <eob> and expertise for that # decision in the team. <eob>
And this brings difficult trade-offs. <eol>
Can we physically co-locate our people are <eob> working in different buildings, <eob> different cities or different countries today? <eol>
Or should we invest <eol> in better videoconferencing? <eob>
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in the way # we do things <eob> across these <eob>
We still some kind <eol> of management <eob>
Now, all <eob> these changes structure <eob> process and procedure -- <eob> xxxx # are not
in the end, I found that the # most difficult thing to change <eol> xx our own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
Let me # try to illustrate. <eol>
we # want these teams to <eol> be <eol> fast, <eob> flexible, creative, like <eol> a xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> they have to be empowered and autonomous. <eob>
But this xxxxx we cannot have leaders <eol> commanding their people what to do, <eol> when # to do, how to <eol> do.
No micromanagers. <eob>
it also means that <eol> each <eol> xxxxx to # become a leader, <eob> regardless of # their formal # <eob> title.
It's about all of us stepping up to take initiative.
Now # obviously, we also # <eob> cannot afford <eob> to have # all teams <eob> running in different directions, xxxxxxx that would <eol> certainly lead to chaos. <eob>
So we <eob> xxxxxxxxx and autonomy <eol> at the same time, <eol> just a flock of <eob>
In an organizational setting, <eob> requires new behaviors, <eob> and with each new behavior, there # is <eob> giving up on <eol> something old as well.
Leaders have to # make <eob> sure <eob> xxxx # everyone in the organization <eol> is aligned around <eol> the overall -- # the why -- <eol> overall priorities -- the what. <eob>
then they <eol> have to let # go <eol> and trust # their # teams to make the right decisions <eol> on how to get # <eol> there.
Now, creating <eob> alignment requires open and transparent communication.
But you how they say <eol> that <eob> information <eol> # is a source of power? <eob>
Well, for some managers, sharing information may # feel as they're giving up that source of power.
it's <eob> not just managers.
xxx teams need to communicate <eol> openly and transparently well. <eol>
In these xxxxxxxxxx xxx <eol> teams <eol> typically work # in short sprints, <eob> and at the # end of every sprint, <eob> they organize a demo session share the <eol> output what they've transparently. <eob>
And every each # member of the gives <eob> # an update <eob> of what they are # <eob> working on individually. <eol>
Now, all this transparency can xx uncomfortable people, because there xx <eob> no place to # hide anymore.
Everything we do <eol> is xxxxxxxxxxx # for everyone. <eob>
So, # is not easy, providing autonomy not xx obvious, either.
One executive at another company <eob> likes to explain xxx he used to be <eol> a master of <eob> milestone-tracking.
Now, # today, to know how things # are # going, <eob> instead of looking at reports, <eob> he needs to walk down the team floors to attend one <eol> of their sessions. <eob>
And instead of telling people what to do, <eob> he looks for ways to help them.
That is <eob> xxxxxxx change <eob> for someone who used to xx <eol> a master of <eol>
But in the xxx world, this executive # <eob> said, <eob> "I only had the illusion xx control. <eol>
In reality, many <eob> projects would over time and xxxx budget, anyway. <eol>
Now I have xxxx more <eob> and # I can course-correct <eol> much if needed". <eob>
And middle <eol> need to change as well. <eol>
First xx all, without the handovers <eol> and # the PowerPoint, <eob> there's less of a xxxx <eob> for middle managers. <eob>
And in the world, there was <eob> idea of <eob> thinkers # and doers.
Employees would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, instead of # only xxxxx people, <eol> middle xxxxxxxx were xxxxxxxx <eob> become player-coaches. <eob>
So imagine, for the 10 you have <eob> # just been telling xxxxxx <eob> what to do, <eol> but now # you're expected <eol> to do things yourself again. <eob>
this model is not for everyone, <eol> and some great leave the xxxxxxxx <eob>
But the result is # a new xxxxxxx <eob> with less hierarchy. <eob>
And xxx this is hard work. <eob>
But it's worth <eol>
The that I worked # <eob> with, <eob> they were used to deploying new product <eol> a few times per year.
Now they have xxxxxxxx every few weeks, <eol> and without the handovers and the red tape, the whole # organization <eob> becomes more efficient. <eob>
And if walk the halls <eol> xx these companies today, you just a <eol> # energy. <eol>
It feels as if you're walking <eol> the of a very xxxxx # start-up. <eob>
Now, be fair, these companies, <eob> they cannot claim xxxxxxx yet. <eol>
But at least <eol> with this new model, <eob> they are <eob> much better prepared <eol> to respond to change. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> more xxxxxxxx <eol> so we need reboot our way of working.
And the hardest of that <eol> is not in structure <eob> or xxxxxxx or procedure, <eob> and it's also not just <eol> senior # executives xxxxxx charge. <eob>
Leaders will be all of <eol> in the organization <eol> who embrace the change.
xx all # have xx lead change. <eob>
So the question <eob> is: <eob> What are willing to give up? <eob>
Thank you.

[The Way Work] <eob> My is Dan, I'm x partner <eol> at a global creative consultancy. <eol>
But there's another side to # <eol> me: <eob> Carrie Dragshaw, <eob> the character I created on Instagram. <eol>

I started getting these incredible messages from people about how happy it made them, <eob> how encouraged them <eol> to <eol> be their authentic selves. <eol>

As <eob> xxxx as # they can find good Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't care where they are. <eob>
Our focus <eob> on <eob> distributed work <eob> didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It was a xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob> from the very <eob> beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't the word "remote," <eol> because it sets up <eol> the expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> and some <eob> aren't. <eob>
x use the xxxx "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> on # an playing field. <eol>
I think a distributed # workforce is <eob> the most effective way <eol> xx build a # company. <eob>
The xxx is you have to <eob> approach it consciously. <eob>
When we started WordPress, <eob> many the # first 20 hires <eob> were xxxxxx I'd never met in person. <eob>
But we'd collaborated xxxxxxx sometimes for years.
wanted to continue # xxxx <eob> for # simple reason. <eol>
I believe that talent and intelligence <eob> are equally distributed throughout <eol> the <eob> world. <eol> But opportunity is not. <eob>
In <eol> Silicon Valley, <eob> the tech # companies fish <eol> from essentially <eol> the same small <eob> pond or # bay. <eol>
x distributed xxxxxxx <eol> can fish <eob> from xxx entire ocean. <eol>
Instead of hiring someone # grew up <eob> in <eob> Japan but lives in <eob> you can gain someone who xxxxxx works, <eol> wakes up and # goes to sleep <eob> wherever they <eob> are in the world. <eob> xxxx bring a different <eol> understanding of culture <eob> and a <eob> different lived experience.
At the base of <eob> to go distributed, xxxxxxx a desire to give people autonomy over xxx they # do their work.
Unless you're in a role <eol> where hours are important, you # can # your own schedule.
Everyone can have corner office, <eol> their windows, the # food they want to <eol> eat, <eob> you can choose when there's music <eol> and when there's silence. <eol>
You xxx what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You can save the time <eol> you'd spend commuting and put it into things <eol> that are important to you. <eob>
A distributed # workforce <eob> xx xxxxx for x <eob> technology company. <eob>
But people often me, <eob> works great for xxxxxx <eob> but what about everyone else?" <eol> If <eob> you # have an office, <eob> you do a things <eob> to build xxxxxxxxxxx capability. <eob>
First: xxxxxxxx everything. <eob>
In an office, it's easy <eol> to make decisions in <eol> # moment, <eob> in # the kitchen, # the <eob>
But people work remotely <eob> and some members of xxx team <eol> are having conversations <eob> don't have xxxxxxx see these decisions made without understanding the why. <eob>
Always leave a trail where you were and what # you were thinking about. <eob>
This allows others to # pick up <eol> where you left off.
It allows in # <eol> time zones to interact, <eol> it's also great # to think about as an organization evolves, <eol> people and xxxxxx <eob>
Try to have # much # communication <eol> as possible online. <eob>
When everything's shared and <eob> public, <eob> xx # allows # new people to catch up <eob>
You also need to find the tools. <eob>
There are so many apps and services <eol> that help <eol> with day-to-day <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eol>
The things that changed how you <eol> probably # aren't objects <eob> anymore. <eob>
xxxxxx you access <eol> through your computer. <eol>
So experiment xxxx different <eol> tools that <eob> enable <eob> see what xxxxxx <eol>
Create productive, xxxxxxxxxxxx time.
In a traditional office, <eob> you're in the same place <eob> weeks out of xxx year <eol> and you might have <eol> three or four weeks <eol>
We <eol> xxx to that: we <eob> come <eob> # together for short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the entire company comes together a week. <eol>
It's half-work, half-play. <eol>
primary is xxxxxxxxxx <eob> We # want <eob> to make <eol> # sure everyone's aligned and on <eob> same page, <eob> and they have a deeper <eol> with their colleagues. <eol>
When they xxxx together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they <eob> can bring xxxxxxxx that understanding and empathy. <eol>
And <eob> # the final practice: <eob> give <eob> people the <eol> to make their own work environment.
Every person at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend <eol> xxxx they can put <eol> towards a co-working space <eob> or just to buy coffee, so don't <eob> get kicked out # of the <eob> coffee <eob> shop.
One group in Seattle <eol> decided pool their stipends together <eob> and # rented a <eob> workspace on a pier.
Each xxxxxx who the company gets a home-office <eob> stipend.
This is # money they can invest xx getting the <eob> xxxxx chair, monitor, <eob> the right desk setup, so can <eol> have the most productive environment for them.
Today, there are just a few companies <eob> that are distributed first. <eob>
In a decade or xxxx <eol> I predict # that # 90 # percent <eob> of companies <eob> that are going to be <eol> the course of the # world <eob> are <eob> going <eob> to function this
They will evolve to be distributed first, <eol> or <eob> they'll be replaced by those that are. <eol>
As you think xxxxx <eob> xxxx you're going to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eob> into global xxxxxxx <eob> give xxxxxx autonomy to live and work <eol> xxxxx <eob> # they feel they xxxxxx <eob> still xxxxxxxxxxx fully in whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eol>
