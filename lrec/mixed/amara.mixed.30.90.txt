Imagine waking up to <eob> # a stranger xx <eol> sometimes multiple strangers # -- questioning your right to <eob> for something that # you <eol> wrote online, <eob> waking up to an # <eol> scared # and worried <eob> for your safety.
Welcome to xxx world of cyberharassment. <eob>
The <eob> kind of # <eob> harassment that women xxxx in # xxxxxxxx is very # serious <eob> and leads sometimes <eol> xxxxxx <eol> outcomes. <eol>
This kind # of xxxxxxxxxx women <eob> accessing # xxx internet <eol> # -- <eol> essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's a form of # oppression. <eob>
Pakistan <eob> xx the sixth most populous <eol> xxxxxxx in the world, with 140 million people having access <eob> to mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 # percent penetration. <eol>
And this number doesn't to <eob> go xxxx <eob> with the # rise of new # technologies. <eob>
Pakistan is also xxx birthplace <eob> # xxx # youngest # Nobel Peace Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eol>
# that's just one aspect of Pakistan. <eol>
xxxxxxx aspect is where <eol> the twisted concept of honor is # linked xx # women # their bodies; <eol> where men are allowed to disrespect # women and # even # kill them sometimes in the <eob> name of so-called # "family honor"; <eob> where women are xxxx to die right outside their # houses <eob> for speaking <eob> to # <eob> x man # on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor". <eol>
Let me xxx this very <eol> clearly: <eob> it's # not # honor; it's cold-blooded <eob>
I come from a <eob> # very small village <eol> in Punjab, # Pakistan, <eob> where are not # allowed <eol> pursue their higher education. <eol>
The elders # of my extended didn't allow their <eol> women to pursue xxxxxx education <eol> or <eob> professional careers. <eol>
However, unlike the # other male guardians <eob> of # <eob> my family, <eol> my father one xxx really my ambitions.
To get my law xxxxxxx <eob> of course, it was really difficult, <eob> and [there were] xxxxxx of disapproval.
But # in the end, I knew <eol> it's xxxxxx me or them, <eol> and I chose myself. <eol>
(Applause) <eol>
My family's traditions <eob> and expectations for a woman <eob> # allow # me xx own <eol> a mobile phone until x was married.
And # xxxx when x # <eol> married, <eol> tool became a <eol> for my # surveillance. <eol>
When I resisted idea of being surveilled my he # really didn't approve <eol> of this xxx threw out of xxx house, <eob> along with my <eol> six-month-old <eol> son, Abdullah. <eob>
And was the time xxxx <eob> I first xxxxx myself, "Why?
Why are women not allowed <eol> to # enjoy # <eob> the xxxxx rights enshrined in our Constitution?
While the law that a woman <eob> has the same equal access <eob> xx the information, <eob> why is # always men -- brothers, <eol> fathers # and husbands xx <eob> # xxx granting <eob> these rights # to us, <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx making the # law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I to take a # step, instead of xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> these patriarchal <eol> and societal
I founded the xxxxxxx Rights Foundation in 2012 <eob> to address all the # issues <eob> and <eob> women's # in online spaces and # <eob> cyberharassment. <eob>
xxxx lobbying # free and safe internet to convincing young # women that xxxxxx to xxx safe internet is their fundamental, <eob> basic, human right, I'm <eob> trying to my part in igniting the spark <eol> xx <eob> address xxx questions that xxxx bothered me xxx these years.
With a <eob> hope in xx <eob> and <eob> to offer a solution to menace, <eol> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eol> first cyberharassment help <eol> line <eol> in December 2016 xx xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xx extend my # support # to xxx women xxx not xxxx who # <eob> xx turn to <eol> face xxxxxxx # threats # online. <eob>

We're at a xxxxxxxx # moment.
xxxxxxxx xx our # xxxxx institutions <eob> are failing <eob> us.
Why?
In some # <eol> cases, because they're <eob> or <eol> but often, they've taken to the objectives. <eol>
And this is #
This has to #
How are we going to # correct these wrongs?
How # we <eob> xx choose xxx right course? <eol>
xxxx <eol> not xxxxx to easy. <eob>
xxx # I've with talented teams <eol> and they've chosen # the right objectives <eob> and <eob> # the <eob> wrong objectives.

Let's go # back # xxxxx <eol>
Yep, xxxx is me. <eob>
I've a <eob> lot to <eob> learn, xxx a computer # engineer, I've <eob> # <eol> got long hair, but I'm # working under Andy xxxxxx <eol> who's been xxxxxx the greatest manager of # his or # <eob> any other
Andy <eol> a superb # <eob> leader and also a teacher, <eol> he said to # xxx # "John, it almost doesn't matter what xxx know. <eol>

And # xx # invented a system called "Objectives # and #
It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? <eob>
xxxx xxxxx excellent <eol> execution. <eob>
So x xxxxxxx video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove. <eob>
(Video) Andy Grove: # The two key phrases <eol> of the xxxxxxxxxx by objective systems <eol> xxx the <eob> objectives the key <eol> results, <eob> and they match <eob> the two purposes.
The objective xx xxx <eol>
The key results have xx xxxxxxxxx <eob> but at # xxx end you xxx look xxx without # any argument say, "Did # I that, or did I <eob> # do that?" <eob> Yes. No. Simple. <eol>
xxxx Doerr: That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
Objectives and Key Results, <eob> or # OKRs, <eob> are a simple goal-setting system <eob> and they work for # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> they work for teams, <eob> they # even work for individuals. <eol>
The objectives are what you # to have # accomplished.
The key results are how I'm going to get that done.
Objectives. Key results. <eob>
and how. <eob>
But here's many of us are <eol> setting goals wrong, <eob> most xx us <eol> are not setting goals at all. <eob>
A # lot of organizations set objectives and meet them.
They ship their <eob> sales, they introduce their new products, they make their <eol> but they <eob> lack a xxxxx of <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> to inspire teams. <eol>
So how do you set xxxxx xxxxx the xxxxx way?
First, # you must xxxxxx the <eob> question, <eol> "Why?" <eob> <eol>
Because <eol> combine xxxxx ambitions <eob> to their passion and to purpose, and # develop a # clear <eol> and compelling sense of <eob>
I want tell # a story. <eol>
I work with <eob> a remarkable
Her name xx xxxx Kim.
She runs a company xxxxxx Nuna.
# is health xxxx data company.
And when Nuna was # founded, <eob> they used data to serve health needs of lots of workers at large companies.
And <eob> # xxxx two # years into the company's xxxxx <eol> the xxxxxxx issued a <eob> build <eob> the xxxxx ever <eol> cloud database for Medicaid.
Now, <eob> you'll xxxxxxxx that Medicaid is that program that <eol> serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children <eob> and <eol> people # with disabilities. <eob>
Nuna at the time # was just <eob> 15 # people <eob> and database had to xx # built in one # year, <eob> and they <eob> a whole set of <eob> that they had to honor, <eob> and frankly, weren't going to make <eol> very much money on # project. <eol>
This xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx moment, <eob> and Jini # seized it. <eob>
She jumped at the opportunity. <eol> She not <eob> flinch.
Why? <eob>
Well, it's a personal <eol>
xxxxxx younger brother Kimong has autism.
And when <eol> # he was seven, xx <eob> # had # his first grand mal seizure <eol> at Disneyland. <eob>
He fell <eol> to xxx ground. <eol> He stopped breathing. <eol>
Jini's parents <eob> are immigrants.
They # came to <eol> the <eob> with <eob> limited resources <eol> speaking little <eol> xxxxxxxx <eob> so it was up to Jini enroll her family in <eol> Medicaid. <eol>
She was xxxx years # old. <eol>
That moment defined her xxxxxxxx <eol> and that mission became her company, <eol> and xxxx company bid on, # and delivered on # that contract.
Here's Jini to <eob> tell you why. <eol>
(Video) Jini # Kim: Medicaid <eob> saved <eol> xx xxxxxx <eob> from # bankruptcy, <eol> and today it xxxxxxxx # for Kimong's health and # millions of others. <eol>
Nuna # xx xx xxxx # <eob> letter to Medicaid.
Every row of data is # a life whose story deserves <eol> be told <eol> with dignity. <eol>
JD: And Jini's story xx that # a xxxxxxxxxx sense of why xxx <eob> # be for our <eol>
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished. <eol>
And xxxxxxxxxx are significant, they're action-oriented, <eol> are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and they're a kind of vaccine <eol> against xxxxx thinking. <eol>
You xxxxx a <eol> be an unlikely user <eob> of Objectives and <eol> Key but # for years, Bono # has used OKRs to wage <eol> a global war <eol> against poverty <eob> # and <eob> disease, <eol> and his ONE organization has on two really gorgeous, <eol> objectives. <eol>
The first is debt <eol> relief for xxx # poorest countries in <eol> the world. <eob>
The next is xxxxxxxxx access <eol> to anti-HIV drugs. <eob>
Now, # why are these # good objectives? <eol>
Let's go back xxx
Significant? Check. xxxxxxxxx # Yes. <eob>
Yes. <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's just listen to Bono.
xxxxxxx xxxxx So you're passionate? <eob>
How # <eob> passionate? <eol>
What actions does your <eob> # passion lead xxx <eol>
If the # heart doesn't xxxx a perfect <eol> rhyme with the head, <eob> then # xxxx passion means nothing.
OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry xxxxxxxxx inside # <eob> it. <eol>
It gives us # an environment for risk, <eol> where xxxxxxx is not a offense. <eob>
And when that sort <eob> of structure and environment <eol> and the <eob> right xxxxxxx <eol> magic is around # the xxxxxxx <eob>
JD: I love that. <eol>
xxxx the madness, and magic is right <eob> around the corner. <eob>
This is perfect.
with Jini covered the <eol> Bono the whats of goal-setting. <eob>
turn our attention xx the hows.
the the xxx results. <eol> we meet our # objectives.
And good <eol> results <eol> specific <eob>
They're aggressive realistic. <eob>
xxxxxxx # <eol> measurable, <eol> they're <eob>
Those are good key results. <eol>
1999, I introduced OKRs to xxxxxxxx cofounders, <eob> Larry and Sergey. <eob>
Here they <eob> xxxx <eol> 24 xxxxx old in their garage. <eol>
And xxxxxx enthusiastically <eob> said he'd adopt <eob> # them. <eol>
Well, not # quite. <eob>
xxxx # he really # said was, "We don't # have # any other xxx to this xxxxxxxx so we'll # it a go". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
And # x <eol> took xxxx # as a kind of endorsement. <eol>
But every <eob> quarter since <eob> # then, <eob> every Googler has xxxxxxx her objectives and key results. <eol>
They've # graded them, <eol> and # they've published <eol> everyone to see.
And these are not <eol> for bonuses or for promotions. <eob>
They're set xxxxxx <eob>
They're used x higher purpose, <eob> xxx to xxx <eol> # collective # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> to truly # <eob> stretch goals. <eol>
In 2008, a # <eob> Googler, xxxxxx Pichai, took # on xx xxxxxxxxx which was to <eol> the # next generation xxxxxx platform <eob> for # the # future xx web applications -- <eob> # words, build the best browser. <eob>
xx was # thoughtful <eol> how <eol> # he chose key results. <eob>
How measure the best browser?
It be ad # xx engagement. <eol>
xxx He said: numbers <eob> users, <eol> because users are # going decide if Chrome is a great browser or not. <eob>
So he had one <eob> three-year-long objective: <eob> xxxxx the xxxx # browser.
And then every he stuck to the same key results, numbers of users, but <eol> he upped xxx ante. <eob>
xx # the first year, his was 20 <eob> million users <eol> he xxxxxx <eol> it. <eob>
He # less 10.
Second year, he # <eol> raised <eol> the bar to million. <eob>
xx got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat better.
In # the third year, <eol> he upped xxx <eol> ante xxxx more <eob> to a hundred million. <eob>
He launched an aggressive <eol> marketing campaign, <eol> broader improved the technology, and kaboom!
He got 111 xxxxxxx users. <eob>
why # I like this story, so much for the # <eol> ending, it xxxxx # <eob> choosing the right objective <eol> and then xxxxxxxx to <eol> year after year after year. <eol>
It's <eob> a xxxxxxx story for <eob> a # xxxx like me. <eol>
Now, <eol> I think xx OKRs <eol> as <eol> vessels <eob> that are made <eob> from the whats <eol> hows of <eob> # ambitions. <eol>
What really matters is the why <eol> that we # pour into those vessels.
That's why we # do our work.

What is # history?
It is something # written by the winners.
xxxxx is # stereotype that # history <eob> should be <eob> focused on the rulers, <eol> like Lenin or <eol>
As <eol> a # result, people <eol> many like # Russia, <eol> xxxx at <eob> history as something <eol> that # was predetermined xx determined # by the xxxxxxxx <eob> and common people could # not <eob> in any # way.
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eob> that Russia could ever have been or <eob> ever be a democratic nation, <eob> and this is to the way <eol> has been framed <eob> to the <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> of Russia. <eol>
And <eol> this xx <eob> not <eob> true. <eob>
xx prove it, I <eob> spent two years <eob> my xxxx trying to go 100 years back, <eol> # the year # <eob> the of the Revolution. <eol>
I # asked # myself, if <eol> the and Facebook xxxxxxx # 100 years ago? <eol>
So # last year, we xxxxx a network for dead <eol> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and <eob> x created our <eob> # software, digitized and uploaded <eol> xxx possible real diaries and letters xxxxxxx # more people <eob> years ago.
So any xx <eob> our website xx application can follow # a news feed <eol> for each day <eol> of # xxxx <eob> xxxx what <eob> people <eob> like Stravinsky or <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> and xxxxxx thought # and xxxxx <eob>
We watch <eol> all those xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> # ordinary people like you and # me, <eob> not demigods, <eob> and we see xxxx history <eol> consists <eob> of their mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius ideas".
Our project was a xxxxx for xxxx Russians, <eol> who used to xxxxx that our country has always # been an autocratic empire and xxx ideas of freedom democracy <eob> could # never have # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> just # democracy <eob> xxx not our # destiny. <eol>
But if take x broader look, it's not that <eob> xxxxx and white.
Yes, 1917 # led to # 70 xxxxx <eol> of communist <eol> dictatorship. <eob>
But <eob> with this xxxxxxxx we # # that Russia could xxx a different history and a democratic future, <eob> xx any xxxxx country could # still can. <eob>
Reading # the xxxxx from xxxxx <eob> you xxxxx that xxxxxx was <eob> xxx first country # xx the <eol> # xxxxx <eob> abolish # the death # xxxxxxxx <eob> or one of first ones <eol> to grant # women voting xxxxxxx <eol>
Knowing history and understanding <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eol> can us create a better # future, because just a xxxxxxxxx <eob> of # what's happening right xxxx
We do need new # ways of # telling <eol> and year, example, <eol> we a new project <eob> that is # called 1968Digital.com, and <eob> is series that gives you an <eob> impression <eob> of that year, # 1968, <eol> year marked xx global social xxxxxx that, in many ways, created the xxxxx as we know now. <eol>
xxx we # are making that history <eob> # alive <eob> by imagining xxxx if all <eob> main <eol> characters could use mobile phones ... <eol> just like that? <eol>
And we # see that a lot of individuals were facing # <eob> the same challenges and # were fighting for the same # values, <eol> no matter if they <eol> lived <eol> # or in <eob> or in France or xx China <eob> or Czechoslovakia. <eob>
By exposing history <eob> in such democratic way, <eob> through social media, we # show that people in power <eob> not <eol> the only xxxx <eob> xxxxxx # choices. <eol>
xxxx # gives xxx user possibility <eol> reclaiming history.
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They have an xxxxxxx

Computer algorithms <eob> # <eob> today <eol> are <eol> performing incredible tasks with high accuracies, at a xxxxxxx scale, <eol> using human-like <eob>
And <eob> this intelligence <eob> xx xxxxxxxxx <eol> is often to as AI <eol> or artificial # <eol> intelligence.
AI is # poised to make an incredible impact <eob> on our lives # xx the future. <eol>
Today, <eob> we still face massive challenges <eob> in detecting and diagnosing <eol> several illnesses, xxxx as infectious diseases and cancer.
Thousands xx patients every year lose their lives <eol> due to liver and oral <eob>
best way to help these patients is to perform xxxxx detection and # of <eob> these <eol> diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, <eob> can artificial intelligence help? <eol>
In patients who, unfortunately, are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert # physician xxxxx orders <eol> expensive medical imaging technologies such as fluorescent imaging, <eol> CTs, MRIs, # to # be performed. <eob>
those images are xxxxxxxxxx another xxxxxxxxx xxxx # diagnoses # images to the patient. <eob>
As you can xxxx # xxxx is <eob> a very # resource-intensive process, <eol> expert physicians, <eol> expensive medical # technologies, <eob> and # is <eob> not considered practical <eol> for the xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
And in xxxxx in xxxx <eol> industrialized # nations, as well. <eol>
So, we # <eol> solve this problem <eol> using xxxxxxxxxx intelligence? <eob>
Today, if # were # to use traditional <eol> artificial intelligence architectures to this problem, <eol> I would require # 10,000 <eol> -- <eob> I # repeat, on an order of xxxxxx <eob> of very expensive medical xxxxxx <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After # xxxxx I would then <eob> # go <eol> to physician, <eob> who then # analyze <eol> those <eob> xxxxxx xxx <eob> me.
And using those two pieces <eol> of information, I # can train a standard # deep neural xxxxxxx <eol> or a xxxx learning network <eob> to xxxxxxx # patient's #
Similar # # xxx approach, <eob> traditional artificial intelligence # approaches xxxxxx from the same <eob>
Large xxxxxxx of data, expert xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and expert medical technologies. <eob>
So, can xx invent # more effective <eol> and xxxx # valuable artificial <eol> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve xxxxx <eol> very <eol> problems <eob> facing xx today? <eob>
And is exactly <eob> what group xx <eob> MIT xxxxx does.
We have invented a variety <eol> of unorthodox architectures <eob> to solve some xx the # xxxx important <eob> challenges facing <eol> us today <eob> xx # medical imaging and # clinical xxxxxxx <eob>
In the example I with xxx today, we had two goals. <eob>
Our <eob> first was xx reduce <eol> the number of images <eol> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence # algorithms.
Our <eob> second goal -- we were more ambitious, xx wanted to # reduce the # use <eob> of expensive medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen xxxxxxxxx <eob>
So how did # we it? <eol>
# our xxxxx goal, instead starting with tens # and thousands of very # expensive # medical <eob> like # traditional AI, started with <eob> a single medical image. <eob>
this image, my team and I <eol> xxxxxxx out a very # clever way <eol> to extract billions <eol> of information packets. <eob>
These packets <eob> included colors, pixels, geometry and # rendering <eob> of the disease <eol> on the medical image. <eob>
xx <eob> a sense, we <eob> xxxxxxxxx one # image <eol> into # of data points, <eol> massively reducing the <eob> amount # <eob> # data needed xxxxxxxxx <eol>
For our second goal, <eob> xx reduce the use of expensive # medical <eob> imaging technologies to <eob> xxxxxx patients, xx # with # x standard, <eol> # photograph, acquired either from x DSLR camera x mobile xxx # the # patient. <eol>
Then remember <eob> xxxxx <eol> billions information # packets? <eob>
overlaid xxxxx xxxx the medical xxxxx onto this image, <eob> creating xxxxxxxxx <eob> that <eob> we a # composite <eol> xxxxxx
Much to our # surprise, <eol> we xxxx required # -- <eob> I repeat, 50 <eol> of composite xxxxxx to train <eob> our algorithms to high efficiencies. <eob>
To <eob> # summarize our <eob> approach, <eol> instead of using 10,000 <eol> very expensive medical images, <eob> we can now the AI # <eob> an unorthodox way, <eob> using only of these high-resolution, <eob> but standard photographs, <eol> acquired from DSLR cameras <eol> and mobile xxxxxxx <eol> and diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eol> our algorithms accept, <eol> in the future xxxx right <eob> # now, <eol> some very simple, # xxxxx photographs from <eol> # the patient, <eol> # of xxxxxxxxx <eob> imaging <eob> technologies.
I xxxxxxx # that we are poised <eob> to enter an era xxxxx artificial intelligence <eob> is going to # make <eob> an impact on our future.
And I think that xxxxxxxx <eol> about <eob> traditional AI, which is application-poor, <eob> xx should <eob> also continue thinking <eob> unorthodox artificial <eob> intelligence which # can accept small amounts of data xxx # some the most <eob> problems xxxxxx us today, <eob> especially # <eob> in health care. <eol>
xxxxx you very <eob>
(Applause) <eob>
What # if # you could take # a or vaccine and, just like # getting # over a xxxxx <eob> you could # heal your wounds # faster?
Today, <eob> if we have an <eob> operation or xx accident, <eol> we're in the hospital for # <eol> weeks, <eob> and often left with scars <eol> and # side effects <eol> of <eob> our inability xx regenerate <eob> or regrow # healthy, uninjured <eob>
I work to create materials that instruct our immune <eob> to give <eob> the signals to grow tissues. <eob>
Just like vaccines instruct <eob> our body to xxxxx disease, <eol> could instead instruct <eol> xxx immune system <eob> to build # tissues and more <eob> quickly xxxx # wounds. <eob>
Now, body xxxxx <eol> out # of xxxxxxx <eol> might <eol> seem like magic, <eol> but there are # several organisms that can # achieve this
Some xxx # regrow <eob> their the humble salamander can # completely regenerate their # arm, <eob> and even us mere humans <eol> can regrow our liver after losing more than half of its # original mass. <eol>
To make this magic a # bit <eob> closer to reality, <eob> I'm xxx xxx body can heal wounds and xxxxx tissue <eol> instructions <eol> from the xxxxxxx <eol>
From # a xxxxxx on xxxx knee <eol> that sinus our immune system defends <eol> our body <eol> from xxxxxxx <eol>
I'm an immunologist, <eol> # by using I know <eob> about xxx xxxxxx defense system, <eol> I # to identify key xxxxxxx <eol> our fight # xx build # back our cuts <eol> # and bruises. <eol>
When looking at materials <eol> that are currently being tested <eob> xxx their abilities to help regrow <eob> muscle, <eol> our team noticed that treating <eol> an injured muscle with # materials, <eob> there was a number of immune cells <eob> in # that material and the surrounding # muscle. <eol>
So this case, <eob> xxxxxxx of the xxxxxx cells # rushing off <eol> towards # infection xx # xxxxxxxxx <eol> they're rushing toward xxxxxxx <eol>
I <eob> discovered a # specific <eol> type of # cell, <eol> helper T <eob> # cell, <eob> xxx present inside <eob> that material that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound # healing.
Now, just # like <eob> when you were a kid you'd break <eob> pencil <eob> and try and tape it together again, <eol> can xxxxx <eob> but it not be <eob> in the most # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eol> and we'll <eob> get x scar. <eol>
So # xx we # don't these <eob> helper cells, instead of healthy muscle, <eol> our muscle develops <eob> fat # cells inside of xxx <eol> and # if fat in our <eob> muscle, <eob> xx isn't <eol> as strong. <eob>
using our immune system, our body could grow # xxxx without these <eob> scars <eob> xxx look like what it before <eob> we were even injured. <eol>
I'm to create materials <eol> that give us the signals <eob> to build new tissue <eol> by changing the immune response.
We know xxxx any # time <eol> x material <eob> is implanted <eob> in our body, the immune system will xxxxxxx to it.
This # ranges from pacemakers <eol> insulin <eob> # pumps <eob> to materials <eol> that engineers using <eob> to and <eob> build new tissue.
So when I place # that or scaffold, in xxx body, <eob> the xxxxxx system creates <eob> a small environment # xx cells and <eob> # xxxxxxxx <eob> that # can change the way that our stem xxxxx behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather affects xxx activities, like going for x run <eob> or staying inside # xxx binge-watching <eol> an # entire TV show on <eob> # xxxxxx of a <eol> affects the <eol> our stem cells grow # and # develop. <eol>
If we have the wrong # <eol> signals, say the xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> xx <eol> get fat cells instead # of muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are xxxx <eob> xx a <eob> variety # of different things, <eob> from plastics to <eob> derived materials, <eob> of varying thicknesses, <eol> sponges that are more or less porous, gels of different <eob> stiffnesses. <eob>
researchers <eob> can even # xxx materials <eob> different signals over time.
So in other words, we # xxx orchestrate <eob> Broadway # show # of cells <eol> by giving them # the correct <eol> cues # and <eol> props <eol> that # can be xxxxxxx # for xxxxxxxxx # tissues, just like a producer would change the set <eob> for "Les Mis" versus xxxxxxx <eol> # Shop # of Horrors". <eob>
I'm # combining specific types of signals <eob> xxxx mimic how our body responds to injury <eol> to help xx regenerate. <eol>
In # the xx could xxx <eol> a scar-proof xxxxxxxxx x moldable muscle filler <eob> or even a wound-healing xxxxxxxx
Now, we aren't going to wake up <eol> and to <eol> heal like Wolverine. <eob>
Probably xxx next <eob> Tuesday, # either. <eob>
But # <eob> with these advances, <eob> and working # with # our immune system <eob> to help build # tissue and # xxxx # wounds, <eol> we # <eob> could <eol> begin seeing <eol> products <eol> on # the market that work with our xxxxxx defense system to help xx <eol> xx able <eol> to xxxx pace with

So, # as a child, <eob> I used to spend of my <eol> great-grandmother's house.
On hot, humid, summer days, <eol> I would dash xxxxxx xxx floor xxx stick my face in front of <eol> her only # air <eol>
But didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> xxxxxx brief, <eob> was privileged # in <eol> our community. <eob>
Growing up, of xxxxxxxxx neighbors having # to # xxx fake energy accounts <eob> or having to steal energy <eob> seemed # <eob> normal to me. <eob>
xxxxxx <eob> winter, struggling to get warm, xx neighbors <eob> # have # no choice <eol> but to bypass the meter <eob> after their was shut off, <eol> just to keep their <eob> # family <eol> comfortable for <eol> xxx more day. <eol>
kinds of dangerous can root <eob> when people are <eol> # faced with xxxxxxxxxx choices. <eol>
In the US, <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> American spends <eob> three of xxxxx income energy. <eob>
In contrast, low-income and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, <eob> even xx percent <eob> of their income on energy.
In 2015, this million # skip # meals <eol> # provide power to their homes. <eob>
This <eob> is # xxxx energy <eob> # a burden.
But energy are so much # more than just a # <eob>
They present impossible <eob> and perilous <eob> choices: Do you take <eol> your child <eob> to her flu <eol> medicine, do you feed her?
Or do xxx keep her warm?
It's an <eol> impossible xxxxxxx xxx nearly every month, seven million # people choose <eol> between medicine <eol> and energy. <eol>
This <eol> xxxxxxx x # much # xxxxxx <eob> and xxxxxxxx <eob>
Families # high energy burdens <eol> disproportionately people of color, <eob> who spend more per square foot <eol> than # <eob> their counterparts.
But also xxxxxxx <eol> and even xxxxxxxxxxxxxx who xxxx into the mass <eol> xx 37 # million people <eol> a year who xxx xxxxxx to afford <eob> for basic needs.
As a those with high energy burdens have a greater likelihood # # conditions <eol> like heart <eob> disease <eob> # asthma.
Look -- given our xxxxxxx to Mars and our pocket-sized AI, <eob> we <eob> have <eob> # the tools to address <eol> xxxxx systemic inequities. <eol>
The technology is here. <eol>

However, even xx xx <eob> # approach cost parity, the <eob> majority xx <eob> those own solar <eol> earn much more than the average # <eol> American. <eol>
xxxx is <eol> why, xxxx I was 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit # RETI.

But <eob> xxxxxxx no one way to solve this.
believe in the power of local xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> in <eol> the <eob> transforming effect xx relationships.
we xxxxxxx <eol> directly <eol> with the xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> that have the highest energy burdens. <eob>
We host # workshops <eob> and events for <eol> to learn <eob> # about energy # poverty, <eol> and how making # even # small <eob> updates to their # homes like insulation for windows <eol> and water <eob> heaters <eol> can xx a long # way # to maximize # efficiency. <eob>
We're # connecting neighborhoods <eol> to community solar <eol> and spearheading xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> home research and # xxxxxxxx xx help xxxxxxxx <eob> bring down <eob> their <eob> energy <eob> # bills.
We're # even <eol> with <eol> officials, <eob> advocating # for <eob> # equitable pricing, <eol> because to see this vision <eob> of energy equity and resilience succeed, we have to work together sustainably. <eol>
Now, # <eob> the US spends <eol> over three # billion a year <eob> energy xxxx <eob> assistance.
And these programs xx help <eob> millions of people, <eob> but xxxxxxx xxxx to <eob> help <eol> a fraction of xxxxx need. <eol>

by building energy equity <eob> and resilience into our communities, <eol> we can assure fair and impartial # access <eol> to energy <eol> that is clean, <eol> reliable and # affordable. <eob>

Have you <eob> xxxx watched a of birds work # together? <eob>
Thousands of animals, in perfect # synchrony: <eol> xxxxx it fascinating? <eol>
What I find remarkable is that birds would <eob> xxx be <eob> able xx do # if they all <eob> xxxxx # have <eob> to follow one leader. <eob>
Their reaction # speed would simply be too # low. <eol>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these birds are aligned <eob> a few # rules, <eob> allowing every # bird <eob> to # <eob> make autonomous # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxx still flying in perfect <eob> synchrony. <eob>
alignment enables their <eob> and # <eob> their autonomy <eol> makes them fast and flexible. <eob>
Now, # what does this have <eob> to do <eol> with one of xxx
Well, it's <eob> # one xxx of xxxxxxxxxxxx what I xxxxxxx # to the most important xxxxxx <eob> is # <eob> needed in ways of working <eob> today. <eob>
The xx getting faster and more <eob> so xx need x new xxx of working, <eob> way that creates <eol> xxxxxxxxx around xxxxxxxx <eob> that takes out bureaucracy <eob> and <eol> that truly <eol> # empowers people to make decisions faster. <eob>
But the xxxxxxxx is: <eob> In order to <eob> get there, what are we willing # <eol> xx give
A few <eol> # <eob> years ago, # I # was # working with a <eol> that to embark <eob> # a digital transformation. <eob>
They wanted their offering to <eob> be # simpler, <eob> more intuitive, more # relevant. <eob>
sure how many you xxxx seen # a # bank from the so let me try # to illustrate what traditional banks look xxxxx
xxx see # lots of people # in suits <eol> taking elevators xx go to their department, <eob> marketers sitting xxxx # marketers, <eol> engineers with <eol> # engineers, etc. <eol>
You <eob> see meetings with # 20 people <eob> nothing # gets # decided. <eob>
Great ideas? They up <eol> in PowerPoint parking lots. <eol>
there are endless handovers <eol> departments. <eob>
Getting anything done can take forever.
So xxxx bank knew <eob> that # in xxxxx to transform, <eob> they would to # improve <eol> their time # to market <eob> by <eob> drastically changing <eol> their <eob> # working xx well. <eob>
But how?
get some <eob> we decided <eol> to # go and have a look xxxxxxxxx <eob> that xxxx to be innovative, <eol> like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.
And I remember how xx were walking the halls at one # these # December 2014, <eol> a xxxxxxxxxx consultant and a team of bankers. <eol>
We felt # like # strangers # in a strange land, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx by beanbags and hoodies <eob> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we xxxxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> is your # organized?" And we expected to get an xxx <eob> # <eob> chart. <eob>
But xxxxxxxx they xxxx strange # drawings with funny xxxxx # like "squads" and "chapters" and # xxxxxxxx <eob> to explain how # they # were organized. <eol>
So then xx # to # translate <eol> that to our own world.
We asked, xxxx many people <eob> are for you?" "It
"Who do you to?" <eol> "It depends". <eob>
"Who decides on # your <eol> priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We were asking for xxxx we thought were # of basic principles <eob> <eol> and <eol> their was, <eob> "It depends". <eol>
Now, the course of that <eol> we gained better <eol> # their model. <eol>
They believed in the power <eob> of small, <eob> autonomous teams. <eob>
Their teams were like <eol>
They had <eob> product people and IT engineers in xxx <eob> same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and test ideas with <eob> customers <eol> independently xx others in the company. <eol>
# not need handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the needed <eob> xxxxx there in <eol> the team. <eob>
Now, at the end of # that had <eol> a session to reflect # on what we had learned. <eob>
And <eol> we had started to like # their model, <eob> so we <eol> were thinking of how <eol> to apply some <eob> # of these ideas # to x <eob>
But then, one of the hosts, <eol> guy who xxx xxx said a word all day, <eob> he <eob> xxxxxxxx <eob> "So I see you our model.
But I have one question # xxx you: <eob> What are you willing to give up?" <eol> What were we willing to give <eob> xxx
did # not <eob> have an answer immediately, <eol> but <eob> we knew # he xxx right. <eob>
Change # is not # only about embracing the new; <eob> about giving up <eob> on some of the old well.
Now, over # the past five years, have xxxxxx <eob> with companies <eob> xxx over the world to xxxxxx their # ways of <eob> working.
And xxxxxxxx # xxxxx company <eob> has their skeptics <eol> about why this is xxx <eob> going # work for # them. <eol>
"Our product is more complex," <eol> or # "They don't have <eob> the legacy IT like <eob> we do," or "Regulators just won't # xxxx <eol> in our industry". <eob>
xxx for xxxx and <eob> also <eob> for <eob> xxx other companies <eob> that I xxxx worked with change xxx
a year, we completely blew up # the old silos <eob> between marketing, product, channels and IT. <eol>
Three # thousand employees xxxx reorganized xxxx 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eol>
So of xxxxxxx people xxxxxxx xxxx # with product people xxx xxxxxxxxx with engineers, <eol> x person <eob> and an engineer <eol> were now members # of the same team. <eol>
You # could be x member of <eob> a team <eol> responsible # for account opening <eol> or xxx the mobile <eol> # banking app, <eol>
At the xxxxxxx date of that new organization, <eol> some # people shaking xxxxx for the very first time, only xx find out that # <eob> they had # <eol> been <eol> sitting two <eol> minutes # xxxx from other but they were # sending each other emails and status reports for xxx last 10 years.
You hear someone # saying, <eob> "Ah, so xxxxxx xxx guy xxxx I <eol> was always chasing for answers". <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But now, they're xxxxxx coffee together # xxxxx day.
If <eob> the product guy has # an idea, <eol> he can just <eob> raise # it get <eob> input from the engineer <eob> who # is <eob> sitting right # next xx <eol> him. <eob>
They can to # test <eol> with # customers immediately -- <eob> no # no PowerPoints, no red # tape, <eob> just getting stuff done. <eob>
Now, # getting there is not easy.
as it xxxxx out, <eol> "What are you willing to give up?" <eob> exactly the right # question to ask. <eob>
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eol>
Instead of decisions <eob> going up # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx we want the team to decide. <eol>
But to # do so, <eob> we <eob> need all # the xxxxxx <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxx for that decision xx the team. <eob>
And this xxxxxx difficult trade-offs.
Can we physically co-locate our people <eob> xxx # are in different buildings, <eol> different cities # or even countries today?
Or should xx xxxxxx <eol> in xxxxxx videoconferencing?
And how do we ensure consistency <eol> in <eob> the way we do # things <eol> across these <eob> teams? <eol>
We still need some kind <eob> xx management matrix. <eob>
Now, all changes <eol> to structure <eol> and # process and procedure -- <eob> they <eol> are xxx <eob> easy. <eol>
But xx the end, <eob> I found that the most <eol> difficult thing <eol> to change is our own <eob>
Let try xx illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams <eol> be <eol> fast, <eol> flexible, creative, # like # mini-start-up, <eob> they # have # to be xxxxxxxxx and autonomous.
But this means we cannot # have leaders <eob> commanding their xxxxxx what to do, when to do, how to do. <eob>
No <eol> micromanagers.
But it also means xxxx # each employee needs to become a leader, <eol> regardless <eol> of # their formal title. <eob>
It's about <eol> all of us stepping to # initiative.
Now xxxxxxxxxx we also cannot to have all these # teams <eol> running # in xxxxxxxxx # directions, <eob> because that would <eol> xxxxxxxxx lead xx chaos. <eob>
So we need alignment # autonomy <eol> at the same <eol> xxxxx <eob> just a of birds. <eob>
In xx organizational xxxxxxxx this requires new behaviors, <eob> xxxx each new # behavior, <eol> there is # giving up <eob> xx something xxx as well. <eol>
Leaders <eob> have to make sure that xxxxxxxx in <eol> the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx aligned around <eol> the overall # purpose -- the why -- <eob> and the overall -- the what. <eob>
But then # they have to <eol> # go <eob> and trust xxxxx to # make the right decisions on how <eob> to <eob> get # <eob> there.
Now, creating alignment requires <eol> open and transparent <eob> communication.
But # you # <eob> know how they say <eol> information is a source of power? <eob>
Well, <eob> for some # managers, <eol> sharing may # feel if <eob> xxxxxx up that source of power. <eob>
And it's not just <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eob> openly and # transparently as <eob> well. <eob>
In these xxxxxxxxxx teams <eob> typically work in <eob> short sprints, <eob> and the end # of every <eob> they # organize # a demo session <eol> to share xxx output <eob> of what they've done, # transparently.
xxxxx day, <eob> xxxx member of gives an xxxxxx <eob> of what they are working individually.
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable xxx <eob> because suddenly, there is <eol> place <eob> to <eob> hide anymore. <eol>
Everything we do <eol> is # transparent for # everyone.
So, alignment xx not easy, <eob> xxx autonomy <eol> is not so xxxxxxxx # either. <eob>
One executive at another <eol> # company likes xx explain how he used to xx <eol> a # of <eob>
Now, today, # know how things are going, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx at reports, <eob> he # needs walk down to the team floors <eol> to # attend xxx <eob> xxxxx sessions.
And instead of xxxxxxx people # what # to xxx <eob> # # ways to # help them. <eob>
That # is xxxxxxx change xxx someone # xxx # xxxx to be a <eob> of # milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # # old world, # this xxxxxxxxx # <eob> said, "I <eob> # had the # control. <eob>
xx reality, projects xxxxx run over time and over budget, anyway.
Now I have much transparency, <eol> xxx I xxx course-correct <eob> much earlier # if needed". <eol>
xxx middle need to change as well. <eol>
First # of xxxx the xxxxxxxxx <eob> and the PowerPoint, <eob> xxxxxxx less # of a xxxx <eol> for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in the there was <eol> this idea <eob> xx # thinkers and # doers. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx would # xxxx follow orders.
But now, instead # only <eol> managing other people, middle managers were expected to # become player-coaches.
So imagine, for last 10 xxxxxx <eol> you have just been <eob> xxxxxxx <eob> # people what to do, <eol> but now you're expected <eob> xx xx things xxxxxxxx again. <eol>
Clearly, <eob> xxxx is xxx for <eol> xxxxxxxxx and some <eob> great people the <eol>
But the <eob> result a xxx <eob> with <eob> # less xxxxxxxxxx
And all # of # this # <eol> hard xxxxx <eol>
it's worth it.
xxx xxxxxxxxx that I worked with, <eol> they were used <eob> new product <eol> features # a xxx # times per year.
Now they every few # weeks, <eob> xxx without the handovers <eol> and the red tape, <eol> the whole organization <eol> becomes more efficient. <eol>
And if # you the xxxxx <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just # feel a new energy. <eob>
It feels if <eob> # you're walking <eob> the halls # of a very large <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, to be fair, these companies, <eol> xxxx cannot # claim xxxxxxx xxxx <eob>
But at least <eob> with this new <eob> xxxxxx <eol> they are # much better prepared <eob> to respond to change. <eol>
The is getting faster <eol> xxx more so xx need to reboot our way <eob> of working. <eol>
And the hardest <eol> part of # change is not # in structure or process or procedure, <eol> and it's xxxx # not just <eob> senior xxxxxxxxxx taking charge. <eob>
Leaders will # be all <eob> # xx the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eob>
We all have to lead <eob> the change. <eol>
So the question # is: What are you to # give up? <eob>
xxxxx you.

As long as they # can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> care where are. <eol>
Our # on distributed work didn't happen accidentally. <eob>
It # was conscious choice from # xxx xxxx beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't use the word # <eob> because sets up # the expectation, that # some xxxxxx are essential and some aren't.
I use the word "distributed" <eol> to describe what we do, <eob> where everyone is <eol> xx # an equal playing field. <eol>
I think a distributed workforce is # the most effective xxx <eob> to build <eol> a <eol>
The <eol> key is you <eob> have # xx <eol> it consciously. <eob>
xxxx xx WordPress, <eol> many of xxx 20 hires <eol> people I'd xxxxx met in person.
But collaborated # online, <eol> sometimes # for years. <eob>
I wanted xx continue <eol> xxx <eob> one simple <eob> reason. <eob>
x believe talent and intelligence <eob> are <eob> equally distributed throughout the world. <eob> But xxxxxxxxxxx is xxxx <eob>
In # Silicon # xxxxxxx big tech # companies # <eol> from essentially <eol> the xxxx small # <eob> pond <eol> or bay. <eol>
A <eob> distributed company can fish # xxxx the entire ocean. <eob>
Instead of hiring someone # who grew up <eob> xx Japan <eol> but lives # in California, <eob> xxx can # gain someone who lives, works, <eob> wakes up and goes to # sleep <eol> wherever they are in the <eob> bring a different <eob> understanding of xxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and a # different # lived experience. <eob>
At <eob> # the base of the # decision <eob> to go distributed, there's <eob> xxxxxx to people <eol> autonomy <eol> they <eol> do # their work. <eol>
Unless # # in a role where # specific are xxxxxxxxxx <eob> you can # make your own schedule.
Everyone can # <eob> have a # corner office, <eol> their windows, the food they xxxx to eat, <eol> you can choose there's xxxxx and when there's silence. <eob>
You can choose what temperature <eob> the room should be.
You save xxx time xxxxx spend commuting <eob> xxx put xx into things that are important to # you. <eob>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is a technology company. <eol>
But people # <eol> xxxxx ask me, "This works # great for y'all, <eob> but <eob> xxxx about everyone else?" <eob> If have # office, <eob> you xxx a # few things to # build distributed # capability.
First: # document <eob> everything.
an office, easy to make decisions <eol> # <eob> the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in
But if people # work remotely <eob> and some of are having those conversations they don't # <eol> have access to, <eob> see these decisions being made without understanding why. <eol>
Always leave a trail of where you were <eob> and what <eob> you were thinking about. <eol>
This to pick up <eob> where you xxxx off. <eob>
xx <eol> allows people in # different time zones to <eol> interact, <eol> it's also great xx think about <eol> as an organization <eob> evolves, <eob> xxxxxx and # joining.
Try to # have # xx much communication <eob> as possible online. <eol>
xxxx everything's and xxxxxxx <eob> it allows new people to # catch quickly. <eob>
You also # xxxx to find the right
There are # so many apps and # services <eob> that <eob> help xxxx day-to-day # <eob> video # conferencing, project management. <eob>
The xxxxxx # changed how # you probably aren't <eob> objects xxxxxxxx <eob>
They're # things you access <eob> your computer.
So # with <eol> tools that enable collaboration, see what works.
# productive, face-to-face time. <eol>
In a traditional # office, <eol> xxxxxx in the same place <eol> 48 weeks out xx the year <eol> and you might have <eob> three or four weeks apart.
We <eob> try to flip that: we come xxxxxxxx <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> Once x year we do a grand meet-up <eob> where the # entire company <eob> comes xxxxxxxx # for a xxxxx <eol>
It's half-work, <eol> half-play. <eob>
The <eol> primary goal <eol> is connecting people. <eol> xx xx xxxx sure <eob> everyone's aligned and on same # <eob> and they have a <eol> xxxxxx # connection with their colleagues.
When they work # together <eol> the rest of # the xxxxx <eob> xxxx can bring # together # understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final xxxxxxxxx give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own <eol> work environment. <eob>
Every # person # at Automattic <eob> has a co-working stipend <eol> that # towards <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> or just to buy coffee, so they don't <eob> get kicked xxx # of the coffee <eob> shop.
One xxxxx in <eob> Seattle <eol> to pool <eob> their stipends together <eol> and rented a xxxxxxxxx # fishing pier. <eob>
Each joins # xxx company <eob> gets a home-office stipend. <eob>
This they can invest <eol> in getting # the right chair, xxxxxxxx <eob> the right desk setup, so can have <eol> the # productive environment xxx them. <eol>
Today, # there are # just a few # companies <eol> that distributed # first.
In a decade or # two, <eol> I that percent companies that # are going to be changing <eol> the course of the <eob> xxx going to function # way.
will xxxxxx to distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by xxxxx are.
xx you think xxxxx <eob> what you're to build next, <eob> consider how you can tap <eob> into global talent, <eol> give # people xx # live and work <eob> where they # they should <eol> and still participate fully in whatever <eob> it xx that you're creating xxxxxxxxx
