Welcome to the world # of cyberharassment.
xxxx of harassment women <eol> face xx # Pakistan is very <eol> and leads to # sometimes deadly
This kind of <eol> harassment keeps women <eol> accessing the internet -- essentially, knowledge. <eol>
It's <eob> x # form of oppression. <eob>
Pakistan # the sixth xxxxxxxx country in xxx world, <eob> with 140 million people having xxxxxx <eob> mobile technologies, <eol> and 15 <eol> percent penetration.
And this number # doesn't seem # # go down <eob> with xxx rise <eob> of new # technologies.
Pakistan also the birthplace of the youngest xxxxx Peace # <eob> Prize winner, <eob> Malala # <eol>
But just xxx of Pakistan. <eol>
Another # aspect is where <eob> the twisted xxxxxxx of <eol> is linked to <eob> women # and their # xxxxxxx <eob> where men are to disrespect women and even them xxxxxxxxx <eol> in the name of so-called "family <eol> where # women are left # die <eob> right # outside their houses for <eob> # speaking to a man on a xxxxxx <eol> in # xxx name of "family honor". <eob>
# me say very clearly: <eol> it's not <eob> honor; a <eob> # murder. <eol>
I come from a xxxx # small <eob> village <eol> xx xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eol> where women xxx not xxxxxxx to xxxxxx their higher xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
elders of xx family didn't allow # xxxxx <eob> women <eob> to xxxxxx their <eol> higher # education <eob> or their professional careers. <eob>
However, xxxxxx # the other male guardians of my family, <eol> my father was # who really supported # my # <eob>
To get <eob> law xxxxxxx <eol> of course, <eol> # really difficult, <eol> and [there frowns of disapproval.
xxx the end, I xxxx <eol> it's <eob> either # me or <eob> xxxxx and chose myself.
xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
xx family's <eob> traditions <eol> and expectations a woman <eob> wouldn't allow me to a mobile phone until married. <eol>
And even when I was married, <eob> this became a tool for my own surveillance. <eol>
When I resisted this <eob> idea <eol> of being surveilled by my <eol> ex-husband, <eol> he # really didn't approve of this <eol> and # threw me of xxx house, <eob> xxxxx my six-month-old son, Abdullah. <eob>
And # that was xxx time <eol> when I xxxxx asked myself, <eob>
Why are # women not <eol> to enjoy xxx <eob> xxxx equal <eol> rights <eob> enshrined # in our # Constitution? <eob>
While # xxx xxxxxx # that a woman <eob> has xxx same # xxxxx xxxxxx <eol> the # information, <eol> why is it # always men xx brothers, <eol> fathers and -- <eol> who # are <eol> xxxxxxxx these xxxxxx to us, <eob> effectively making # the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I decided to # take a step, <eol> instead keep questioning <eol> # patriarchal structures <eob> and societal norms. <eob>
And I <eob> the Digital # Rights <eob> Foundation # in # 2012 <eob> to <eob> address all xxx issues <eob> xxx women's experiences <eol> in online spaces <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From <eob> lobbying for xxxx and safe # internet <eol> convincing young women that access # to the safe internet is fundamental, basic, # human <eob> right, <eol> I'm trying # to play <eob> part xx igniting spark <eol> to address the questions that have # all these years.
With # xxxx # xx # heart, <eob> xxx # to <eob> offer a solution to this menace, <eob> I started Pakistan's xxx the region's <eob> first cyberharassment help line <eob> in December # 2016 -- <eob> <eol>
to support xxx # xxxxx who # xx know <eob> who to xxxx to <eol> when # they face serious threats online. <eob>
I <eob> of the women # <eob> who do xxx have the necessary <eol> to deal the mental trauma <eob> # feel unsafe in <eob> online # <eol> xxxx go xxxxx their xxxxx activities, <eol> thinking xxxx there # # rape # threat in <eol> # their in-box. <eob>
Safe # access <eob> to xxx internet <eol> is xx <eol> access to knowledge, <eob> and is freedom. <eol>
When I fight for women's rights, <eol> xxx fighting xxx equality.

(Applause)
xx a critical <eob> moment. <eol>
Our leaders, <eol> some # of our great institutions xxx failing us. <eol>
xxxx <eob>
xx cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, <eol> xxx often, they've xxxxx us <eol> to the xxxxx objectives. <eob>
is unacceptable. <eob>
This <eob> has # xx stop.
How are xx going to correct # xxxxx wrongs? <eob>
How are we <eob> going <eol> to xxxxxx the <eol> right <eob>
xxx going to # be easy. <eol>
For # years, # I've worked with talented # <eol> teams <eob> and they've chosen <eob> xxx right objectives <eol> xxx wrong objectives.
Many have succeeded, <eob> others of them have failed.
And today I'm going to # share with you what really makes # a xxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> xxxxxx what's <eob> how and # <eol> they xxx meaningful # audacious goals, <eol> the xxxxx <eob> # goals xxx the right # reasons.
Let's # go # <eob> back # to 1975. <eob>
Yep, # is # <eob> me.
I've got a to <eob> xxxxxx <eol> I'm x <eol> computer I've got <eob> long hair, <eol> I'm under # xxxx Grove, <eol> been called the manager <eob> of his # or any xxxxx <eol> era. <eol>
Andy was a leader xxx also <eob> a # teacher, and <eol> he # # to me, "John, <eob> it almost # doesn't matter xxxx you know. <eol>
Execution is xxxx matters the <eob>
And so # x # xxxxxx <eob> xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx and Key Results". <eob>
It kind # off the <eob> xxxxxxx doesn't # it?
And it's all xxxxxxxxx execution. <eol>
So # here's # # classic video from 1970s <eol> xx <eol> professor Andy xxxxxx <eol>
(Video) # Andy Grove: # The xxx key # phrases <eob> xx the management by objective <eob> are the objectives xxx # key results, <eol> and they match the two purposes. <eob>
xxx objective is # the xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
The # key results <eol> have <eob> to measured, <eob> the <eol> end you can look <eob> and without <eob> xxx argument say, <eol> "Did I do or did I not do that?" Yes. No. Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's Andy. <eol>
Yes. No. # Simple. <eol>
Objectives and Key xxxxxxxx <eol> or OKRs, are a simple xxxxxxxxxxxx system and they work for organizations, <eob> they work xxx teams, they even work for individuals.
xxx # are <eol> you want to have accomplished. <eob>
The key are # how <eol> I'm <eob> going to get # xxxx # done. <eol>
Objectives. Key
What and # <eol> how.
xxx xxxxxx the truth: <eol> many xx us are setting # goals <eob> wrong, <eob> xxx most us <eol> are # not setting goals xx xxxx <eob>
lot of organizations <eob> xxx xxxxxxxxxx and meet them. <eol>
They ship their xxxxxx they introduce their # products, they make xxxxx numbers, <eol> but # they lack a sense xx to inspire their teams. <eob>
how do # you set <eol> these goals the right <eob>
First, # you must answer <eob> xxx "Why?" Why? <eob>
Because transformational teams <eob> combine their # ambitions <eol> xx their # passion <eol> and to their purpose, xxx they develop # a clear <eol> and xxxxxxxxxx sense xx why.
I to you a story. <eol>
I # work with a xxxxxxxxxx entrepreneur. <eob>
Her # name is Jini xxxx <eol>
She runs a company called Nuna. <eol>
Nuna is a health care company. <eob>
And when xxx founded, <eob> they used data # to serve the # health lots xx workers at large <eob>
And <eob> two years into the life, the # federal government issued a to build the first # ever cloud database
Now, xxxxxx <eol> # remember that is that # program <eol> that serves 70 million Americans, <eol> our poor, our children <eol> xxx xxxxxx with disabilities.
Nuna <eob> at # the xxxx # <eol> xxx # just <eob> # xx xxx database <eob> had to be built <eob> # xx xxx year, <eob> and they xxx xxxxx set <eob> commitments they had to honor, xxx frankly, they weren't # going # xx <eol> make very much money on the <eol>
This # was a bet-your-company moment, <eob> and Jini # seized xxx <eol>
jumped # at # opportunity. <eob> xxx did not flinch.
xxxx <eob>
Well, xxxx a # <eol> xxxxxxxx why. <eol>
Jini's younger xxxxxxx Kimong has autism.
And # when he xxx seven, xx <eol> had xxx xxx seizure <eob> at Disneyland. <eob>
# xxxx ground. <eol> He <eob>
Jini's <eol> are xxxxxx immigrants. <eob>
They came to # the xxxxxxx with # <eol> resources <eol> speaking little <eob> xxxxxxxx <eol> so it <eol> up # xx # xxxx to enroll family # in Medicaid. <eob>
was nine xxxxx xxxx
xxxx defined her mission, <eob> and that mission became her <eob> company, <eob> xxx that <eol> xxxxxxx bid on, won <eol> xxx <eob> delivered on that # contract.
Here's Jini <eob> # to tell # you xxxx
(Video) Jini Medicaid <eol> saved my family # from bankruptcy, <eob> today it provides for and millions of # others. <eol>
# is my # love xxxxxx to Medicaid. <eob>
Every # row of is a <eob> life <eob> whose story # deserves <eol> to be told with <eol> dignity. <eob>
JD: # Jini's # xxxxx tells us that compelling why <eol> can <eol> the launchpad for our objectives. <eob>
Remember, that's what <eob> xx want to have accomplished. <eob>
objectives are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eol> they are <eol> xxx they're a # kind of vaccine xxxxx thinking. <eob>
You <eob> # think a rockstar be an <eob> unlikely xxxx <eob> of xxxxxxxxxx and Key Results, <eol> but for years, Bono # used xxxx <eob> to # xxxx # a global war <eob> xxxxxxx poverty and disease, <eob> and xxx organization <eob> has xxxxxxx on xxx really gorgeous, objectives.
The # first is xxxx # relief for the # poorest <eol> countries # in world. <eob>
The xxxx is <eol> universal access to drugs.
Now, why these good <eob> objectives? <eob>
Let's # go back xx # our # checklist. <eob>
Check. xxxxxxxxx Yes. <eob>
Action-oriented? <eob>
Inspirational? <eol>
Well, let's <eol> # to <eol> Bono.
(Video) Bono: # So <eob> you're passionate? <eol>
How <eol>
# xxxxxxx does passion <eob> xxxx <eob> xxx # to do? <eol>
If the heart doesn't # find <eol> a <eob> perfect # rhyme with the head, <eob> then # passion means
The OKR framework # cultivates # madness, <eol> the chemistry # contained # inside # <eob> xxx <eob>
gives # us # for risk, <eol> for trust, <eob> where failing not a fireable <eob>
And when xxx have that sort <eol> # <eob> structure xxx environment and the right <eob> xxxxx # around corner. <eob>
JD: love
OKRs cultivate # the and magic # is right <eob> # the corner.
xxxx is perfect. <eob>
So xxxx we've covered the whys, with xxxx # xxx # of # goal-setting. <eol>
Let's turn our # attention <eol> the <eob> hows. <eol>
xxxxxxxxx the <eob> xxxx # are the # key results. <eol> That's xxx # we meet # our <eob>
And good <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound.
xxxxxxx aggressive xxx <eol> # realistic. <eol>
xxxxxxx <eob> and they're verifiable. <eob>
# xxx xxxx key <eob> # results. <eob>
In <eob> xxxxx introduced OKRs <eob> to # Google's cofounders, <eob> xxxxx and Sergey. <eol>
xxxx they are, <eob> # years old # garage. <eol>
xxx Sergey enthusiastically <eol> said he'd adopt them. <eob>
xxxxx quite. <eol>
he really xxxx was, "We don't any other way <eol> to manage this xxxxxxxx <eob> so we'll give it a go". <eob> (Laughter)
And I took xxxx <eol> as a kind of endorsement. <eol>
But quarter since then, every Googler has written down <eol> # objectives and xxx key <eol>
They've # graded them, <eol> and # they've xxxxxxxxx them for everyone <eol> to xxxx
these xxx xxxx <eol> for bonuses # or for promotions. <eob>
xxxxxxx # set # aside.
xxxxxxx used for higher purpose, <eol> and xxxxxx to # get commitment <eob> to truly stretch goals. <eol>
In 2008, # a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective <eob> xxxxx <eol> was to # build <eol> the next client platform <eol> the future of web applications -- in other xxxxx the browser. <eol>
# very thoughtful <eol> how # he chose his # key # results. <eol>
How do you measure the best browser?
could xx clicks # <eol> or engagement. <eol>
No. He said: numbers <eol> of <eob> users # are # going <eob> to decide <eob> Chrome a # great or not. <eol>
So he had this # one <eob> three-year-long # objective: <eob> build xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx <eol>
And <eob> then every <eob> # year <eol> he xxxxx to the xxxx # key # <eob> results, <eol> of users, he upped <eob> the # ante.
In the first year, <eob> his # xxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> and <eob> he missed it. <eol>
He xxx less than <eob> 10.
Second year, <eob> he raised <eol> the bar # to # million. <eob>
He got to 37 million users. <eob>
Somewhat <eol>
In <eob> the xxxxx # year, <eol> he the ante once <eob> # xxxx <eol> to a hundred # million.
xxxxxxxx # an <eol> marketing <eol> campaign, xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx improved # the xxxxxxxxxxx xxx kaboom! <eob>
xxx <eob> # 111 million xxxxxx
xxx I like story, not so # xxx the # xxxxx ending, it shows xxxxxxx <eol> carefully choosing the objective and then xxxxxxxx to it <eob> year # after xxxx after
It's xxxxxxx xxxxx for a nerd like # <eol>
Now, I <eob> think of # <eol> OKRs <eol> as vessels <eob> xxxx made from the # xxxxx <eob> and xxxx of our # ambitions.
What really matters xx # the why <eob> that we xxxx into those # vessels. <eol>
That's why we do our work. <eob>
OKRs are not a xxxxxx bullet. <eol>
They're not <eob> # going to be for a strong culture or # for stronger leadership, # xxxx those <eol> fundamentals are # # place, <eol> they # take you xxx mountaintop. <eob>
I # to think <eob> xxxxx xxxx # for a moment. <eob>
Do you <eob> # <eob> # right <eob>
xxxx xxxx xx write down <eol> xxxx values, your objectives # your key results.
Do it xxxxxx
If you'd some feedback # them, <eob> you can send # to # me. <eol>
I'm john@whatmatters.com. <eob>
If think <eob> xx world-changing goals of an Intel, of a # <eob> Nuna, xx of Google, <eob> they're # remarkable: ubiquitous <eol> computing, <eob> affordable xxxxxx <eob> high-quality for ending <eob> global poverty, <eob> access # to all xxx # information.
Here's the deal: <eob> xxxxx xxx of those xxxxx <eol> xx powered today by OKRs. <eob>
Now, I've been xxxxxx <eob> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx # OKRs <eob> spreading the good gospel <eol> according to # Andy Grove, <eob> xxx I want you <eob> to join # me in this movement. <eol>
Let's fight for what it is <eol> that # xxxxxxxx <eob> because we can # take <eob> xxxx <eol> beyond our xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
We can take them to # families, <eol> to our schools, even to our governments. <eob>
those governments accountable.
We can transform # those informations. <eob>
We can back on the track <eob> if we <eob> can and # do measure <eob> what really xxxxxxxx <eob>

What # history? <eob>
It is <eob> # something written by the winners. <eob>
There is a xxxxxxxxxx that xxxxxxx <eol> should be # focused on xxxxxxx <eob> like # Lenin # or <eob>
xx a result, people xx many xxxxxxxxxx like # <eob> mine, Russia, <eob> look xx history as something xxxx was <eob> predetermined or xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx <eol> and common people could not <eob> influence it in xxx way.
Many Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia could <eob> been <eob> will <eol> a truly # democratic xxxxxxx # this is due # to the way <eob> history has <eob> been framed <eob> xxx # Russia.
And this is true. <eol>
To prove # it, # two <eol> of xx life trying to go # # years # xxxxx to xxx year the xxxx of the <eol> Russian # Revolution. <eob>
I asked what if <eob> internet <eol> and Facebook xxxxxxx years # ago? <eob>
So last year, xx x social network xxx dead # people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team and x created # <eob> our xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx and uploaded all possible # real diaries and letters written by more than 3,000 xxxxxx <eob> 100 ago. <eob>
So any user of our website <eob> or can # follow a <eol> xxxx feed <eol> for each day 1917 xxx read what people xxxx Stravinsky # or Trotsky, <eob> xxxxx xx # Pavlova <eol> and others thought and felt. <eob>
We watch all personalities <eol> being xxxxxx like you and me, <eob> xxx demigods, <eob> # we see that history # of their mistakes, fears, xxxxxxxxxxx xxx # only their "genius ideas". <eol>
xxxxxxx # was a for many Russians, <eol> xxx used to think xxxx xxx xxxxxxx has always been an autocratic empire <eob> and the ideas <eol> of freedom and democracy could <eob> # never have prevailed, just <eol> # because xxxxxxxxx was xxx our destiny. <eob>
xxx if we # take broader <eob> it's not that black and white. <eol>
Yes, # xxxx # led to <eob> of communist dictatorship. <eob>
But this project, we # xxx that Russia <eob> have # had a # <eob> different history <eob> and a xxxxxxxxxx future, <eol> as <eob> any other xxxxxxx or still xxxx <eob>
the posts xxxx # <eol> you learn that Russia <eob> xxx the # first # country # in the to abolish the death penalty, or xxx of the <eob> xxxxx # ones <eob> to grant women # <eol> voting rights. <eob>
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced # history <eob> can <eol> help a better <eob> because history is just a rehearsal <eob> what's happening xxxxx now. <eob>
We xx need new telling history, and xxxxx xxx example, <eob> we started <eob> # a new online # project that is called 1968Digital.com, <eob> xxx that # is # an online series <eob> that # you an impression of year, <eob> a # year by social change <eol> that, many ways, the # <eob> world as we xxxx it
But we # making that history xxxxx <eob> by xxxx if xxx the main <eob> could xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eol>
And we see xxxx a lot <eob> of # individuals <eol> were facing the same xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and were fighting <eol> for the values, <eol> no if they lived <eol> in US or in USSR or xx <eol> France or <eob> xx <eob> # China <eol> or in Czechoslovakia.
By xxxxxxxx history in such a # xxxxxxxxxx way, <eob> through # media, <eob> we show that people in # are not the only ones xxxxxx choices. <eob>
gives any user a possibility <eob> xx reclaiming <eol>
Ordinary people matter. <eol>
They <eob> have an <eob>
Ideas matter. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxxxx # scientists, <eob> philosophers # xxxxxxx <eol>
# xxxxxxxx <eol>
We xxx make history. <eob>

Computer algorithms today xxx performing xxxxxxxxxx xxxxx with accuracies, a xxxxxxx <eob> using human-like xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx intelligence # of # <eol> often xxxxxxxx to xx # <eob> or <eol> artificial intelligence.
AI # xx poised to make an incredible impact <eol> on xxx lives in the future.
Today, however, we still face xxxxxxx challenges <eob> in detecting and several life-threatening illnesses, <eob> such as xxxxxxxxxx diseases and cancer. <eob>
of <eol> patients <eob> every xxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> due to xxxxx and # oral cancer. <eol>
best # way to # help these patients is to # perform early # detection <eob> and diagnoses of these # diseases.
So how do # we detect today, <eol> and can # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> help? <eob>
xx # patients xxxx unfortunately, <eob> are suspected of these diseases, <eol> xx expert physician first expensive medical imaging # technologies xxxx as <eob> imaging, CTs, MRIs, to be performed. <eob>
xxxx those # images are collected, xxxxxxx expert <eob> physician then diagnoses <eol> # talks xx # the patient. <eol>
As you # xxx see, this is <eol> a very resource-intensive process, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # # <eob> expert # physicians, <eob> expensive <eol> imaging technologies, xxx # is not # considered practical the developing xxxxxx
And in fact, <eol> in many <eob> industrialized # nations, xx <eol>
So, can we solve # this # problem using artificial intelligence?
Today, x xxxx to # xxx <eob> traditional <eol> artificial intelligence # architectures to solve this <eob> problem, I would require 10,000 -- repeat, on an order # of 10,000 <eol> of these very expensive medical <eol> first # xx be generated. <eob>
After xxxxx I would then # go <eob> an expert <eob> would # then analyze <eol> those images for # me. <eob>
And # <eol> using those two pieces of # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> I can # a # standard deep neural network <eol> or a deep learning to # provide # xxxxxxxxxx
Similar to the first approach, traditional artificial <eol> approaches <eol> suffer from the same # <eob> problem. <eol>
xxxxx # amounts xx xxxxx # expert # <eob> and xxxxxx # medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx
So, can invent more scalable, xxxxxxxxx and more valuable xxxxxxxxxx <eob> intelligence architectures <eob> to solve these important <eol> problems facing us today? <eob>
And this is exactly <eol> what xx group # at MIT Media xxxxx
We variety <eob> xx unorthodox # AI xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx solve xxxx xx the most important challenges facing us # in medical imaging and # <eob> clinical trials. <eol>
In the <eol> # example I shared <eob> with # today, we two goals. <eob>
xxx # was to reduce <eol> the number of images required to train <eol> artificial intelligence algorithms. <eol>
Our xxxxxx -- we were # more ambitious, <eob> we wanted xx <eob> # reduce <eob> of medical imaging technologies <eob> xxxxxx # patients. <eol>
So how did we do it?
our first goal, xx starting <eol> xxxx # tens and thousands <eol> these very expensive medical images, <eob> xxxx traditional <eob> we started xxxx single # xxxxxx <eol>
xxxx xxxx image, my team and <eob> I <eob> figured out a very <eol> clever # way to extract <eob> # billions <eob> xx <eob> information <eob> packets. <eob>
These information xxxxxxx colors, pixels, geometry and rendering # of xxxxxxx on <eol> the <eol> # <eob> medical image.
In a # we # one image xxxx # billions xx training data points, massively reducing xx data <eol> needed for
xxx our goal, <eol> to # <eol> the # use of # expensive medical imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eob> we started <eol> with a standard, <eol> white light <eob> acquired either # from a # camera <eol> or x mobile # phone, xxx the patient. <eob>
Then remember those <eol> billions # of information # <eol> packets?
xx overlaid xxxxx <eob> from <eob> xxxxxxx <eol> image onto # <eob> this image, <eob> something <eob> that xx call a composite image. <eob>
Much to xxx surprise, <eol> we xxxx required -- <eob> I only 50 -- <eob> these images # <eol> our algorithms # xxxx # <eol> efficiencies. <eol>
To # summarize our approach, <eob> instead of using <eob> # <eob> very medical # images, <eol> we now train the AI algorithms <eol> in # an xxxxxxxxxx way, using <eob> 50 of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard # acquired from DSLR cameras <eob> and <eob> # xxxxxx xxxxxxx <eob> and <eob> provide xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
More # xxxxxxxxxxxx our algorithms # can accept, <eol> in <eob> the future and even right now, <eob> some very simple, # white light xxxxxxxxxxx from the <eol> instead # of expensive <eol> medical imaging technologies. <eob>
I <eol> believe that # xx # to enter <eol> xx # era <eol> where artificial intelligence <eol> is going to make impact # on xxx # future. <eob>
And x think that thinking <eol> xxxxx traditional AI, which is data-rich xxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> # xxxxxx also # continue # <eol> about # <eol> unorthodox artificial <eol> intelligence # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx which can accept xxxxxxx <eob> of data <eob> and xxxxx some xx the most xxxxxxxxx problems facing # us today, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx in health care. <eob>

What if take x pill or a vaccine <eol> xxxx just like getting over a # cold, <eob> you <eob> # could # heal <eob> your wounds faster? <eol>
we have an operation or an # accident, we're # in # the <eob> hospital for # weeks, <eol> and often # left xxxx # scars <eol> painful effects of xxx to regenerate <eob> or # regrow # healthy, uninjured <eol>

Just like vaccines # instruct <eol> xxx xxxx # to fight # disease, <eob> we instead xxxxxxxx <eol> our immune system xx build tissues xxx # # quickly # xxxx # wounds. <eol>
xxxx # regrowing body xxxxx nowhere # seem # like magic, but there xxx several organisms <eob> xxxx xxxxxxx this feat. <eob>

From scrape # xx <eol> to <eob> that # xxxxxxxx sinus infection, <eol> our immune system defends <eol> xxx body xxxx <eol>
I'm xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> and using what I # know about our body's <eob> defense system, <eol> I was able to # identify # key players <eol> in xxxxx to build <eob> back <eob> cuts # bruises. <eob>
xxxxxxx <eob> at that xxxxxxxxx # being tested <eob> for their to # regrow muscle, <eob> our team noticed xxxx after treating <eol> an injured muscle xxxxxxxxxx <eob> there was a large number <eob> of # immune cells in # that material <eol> and # surrounding muscle.

xxxxxxxxxx # <eol> xxxx <eob> of immune cell, helper T cell, was present # inside <eob> that I implanted and absolutely critical for wound healing.
Now, just like when you were a kid <eol> and break your xxxxxx <eol> xxx try xxx <eol> tape it together again, <eol> we can heal, but it <eob> not be <eol> in xxxx <eol> # <eob> functional way, <eol> # we'll get a <eob>
So # if # we don't these xxxxxx # T xxxxxx <eob> instead of xxxxxxx muscle, <eol> xxx <eol> muscle fat cells inside of it, <eob> and # if there's # fat in # our muscle, <eob> isn't as
Now, <eol> using xxx # immune xxxxxxx xxx body # grow back without # scars <eob> and look like # what it was before we <eob> were even <eob> # <eol>
I'm working <eob> to create <eol> that give xx # the signals <eob> to new tissue by # the immune response. <eob>
We know that # time <eol> a # material <eob> is xxxxxxxxx # body, the immune # xxxxxxx # xx # it.
ranges # from xxxxxxxxxx <eol> to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers <eol> to # and # xxxxx new <eob>
when <eob> I place material, scaffold, in the body, the immune system # creates <eol> small # environment <eob> of cells and <eob> proteins <eol> xxxx <eob> can change xxx # way <eol> that # our stem <eob> cells behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> our xxxxx # activities, like going for a run <eob> or inside binge-watching <eob> an entire TV show on Netflix, <eob> the immune environment # # a scaffold <eob> affects # the # way that <eob> our # stem cells # xxxx # and # <eol> develop. <eob>
If we xxxx the wrong signals, <eol> say # xxx Netflix # signals, <eol> we get <eob> xxx cells instead of <eob> muscle. <eob>
xxxxx scaffolds are # made <eob> of a variety of different # <eob> plastics # to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> xxxxxxxxxx of varying thicknesses, that are more or less porous, <eol> gels different stiffnesses. <eol>
And researchers can even xxxx materials <eol> release xxxxxxx time. <eob>
So <eol> # in xxxxxx # orchestrate <eol> xxxxxxxx show cells <eob> xx # giving them <eol> the correct <eob> stage, cues and props <eol> # can # be changed # for different <eob> tissues, <eob> just # like a producer xxxxx change <eol> the set for # "Les # Mis" versus # Shop of Horrors".
xxx combining specific # of signals <eob> that xxxxx our body <eob> to injury to help us # regenerate.
the xxxxxxx we <eol> could see <eol> a # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> band-aid, <eob> a moldable filler even a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, we aren't # to wake up xxxxxxxx xxx xx able to heal Wolverine. <eob>

But <eol> with these # advances, <eob> and xxxxxxx # with our immune system to help and heal wounds, could xxxxx xxxxxx products # the <eol> market <eol> xxxx work with our body's defense system <eob> xx # help us regenerate, <eol> and maybe day be # able <eol> # <eob> keep pace xxxx <eol> a salamander. <eol>

So, as # a child, <eol> I used # to spend # of xx # time at my great-grandmother's house. <eob>
On hot, # humid, summer # days, <eob> I dash # the # floor <eol> and xxxxx my xxxx front # of her only air <eob> conditioner. <eob>
But I didn't realize <eol> that that experience, though brief, <eob> a privileged # xxx <eob> xxx community. <eol>

These xx dangerous <eol> incidents # can take root <eob> when people are # xxxxx <eol> with choices. <eob>
In the US, xxxxxxxx xxxxxx percent of their # income on energy.
In contrast, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> and rural xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can spend # 20, even xx percent <eol> of their <eob> income on xxxxxxx <eob>
2015, xxxx caused <eob> over <eob> 25 # people xx xxxx xxxxx <eol> xx provide power to # <eob> their homes.
This # xx # when energy # becomes # x burden.
xxxxxx burdens are # so xxxx <eob> xxxx <eob> just x <eol> number. <eol>
xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxx choices: <eob> Do you take your child <eol> to her # flu medicine, xx do # you feed her? <eol>
Or do you # keep her
xxxx <eob> an choice, <eol> and # month, seven people choose <eol> between medicine # and energy. <eob>
This a xxxx # larger <eol> and <eol> systemic xxxxxx <eol>
Families with high energy burdens are disproportionately people xx color, <eob> who spend xxxx xxx xxxx than their xxxxx counterparts. <eob>
But it's # veterans <eol> and xxxx schoolteachers <eob> xxx into xxx mass <eol> of 37 <eob> million xxxxxx # a xxxx who <eob> are xxxxxx to xxxxxx energy <eol> for # xxxxx most basic needs. <eob>
As a result, those # with <eol> high energy # burdens <eob> have # a greater likelihood # of conditions <eob> like # heart disease and # asthma. <eol>
Look <eob> # -- given our <eob> # rockets # xx Mars <eol> and pocket-sized AI, we have the tools to # xxxxxxx <eob> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here.
Cost # xx renewables, insulation, <eol> xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and smart xxxx # technology are # decreasing. <eob>
even as <eob> we <eol> the majority of xxxxx who own <eol> # <eob> much more # than the average American.
This is why, when # I was 22, I founded the nonprofit RETI. <eol>
# is to alleviate energy burdens by <eob> working with communities, <eol> utilities and # xxxxxxxxxx alike <eob> provide <eol> to # energy, <eob> energy energy technology. <eol>
But <eol> # there's no one way to solve this.
I believe in # <eob> the xxxxx of # local <eol> in the xxxxxxxxxxxx effect <eol> of relationships. <eol>
So xx by working directly <eol> the communities <eol> xxxx have highest # xxxxxx <eol>
We host <eol> and events # for communities <eol> to <eob> # xxxxxx poverty, <eob> and how making even <eol> updates to their homes <eol> like <eob> xxxxxx insulation windows and heaters <eob> # go # x <eob> long way # xx # maximize efficiency.
We're connecting <eol> to community # solar <eol> and spearheading community-led <eob> smart # home research and # installation xxxxxxxx <eob> to help families bring # down <eol> their # bills.
We're xxxx <eob> working # directly with elected # <eol> advocating for xxxx equitable pricing, <eob> because to see this vision of # energy and resilience <eob> we have to xxxx together <eob> sustainably.
Now, the US # spends over # three billion a year <eob> energy bill <eob> payment # <eol>
And these xxxxxxxx do help <eob> millions # xxxxxxx xxx they're only able xx help <eol> a xxxxxxxx of xxxxx in need. <eol>
In xxxxx <eob> there is <eob> 47-billion-dollar home-energy xxxxxxxxxxxxx # gap, <eob> so assistance alone is not xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But # by building energy <eob> equity and resilience into our communities, we can assure and impartial access to energy that clean, <eol> reliable and affordable. <eob>
At # scale, microgrid <eob> technology, <eob> xxx energy efficiency <eol> dramatically # improve xxxxxx health.
And for those xxxx # high burdens, <eob> it xxx help them reclaim <eob> 20 percent xx their income -- <eol> xx # percent of a <eob> person's income <eob> struggling to make xxxx # meet.
xxxx is life-changing. <eob>
This is xx for # use # their energy savings <eol> to sponsor their <eol> future. <eol>
I xxxxx # back to my great-grandmother <eol> and # her neighbors, <eol> xxx impossible choices <eob> xxxx # they xxxx <eob> and the effect it had <eol> on xxxxx
is # not just about <eob>
There are xxxxxxxx nationwide # having <eol> to make the # same xxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob>
And <eob> # <eol> high energy burdens are a xxxxxxxxxx barrier to xxxxxxxxx <eol> but through relationships <eob> with communities <eol> technology, <eob> we have # the paths to overcome them.

xxxx # ever watched <eol> a flock birds <eob> work

xxxx # I find remarkable # is that these # birds <eol> would not be able to do # that <eol> if they all would to follow one <eol>

Instead, xxxxxxxxxx believe <eol> that xxxxx # birds xxx xxxxxxx # on <eol> a few simple rules, <eob> allowing every single <eol> to xxxx <eob> autonomous decisions while # xxxxx xxxxxx in # synchrony. <eob>
Their # alignment enables their # their xxxxx # fast and xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, what does <eol> this have to xx <eob> with <eob> xxx one # <eob> us?
it's # one <eob> xxx # of illustrating # <eob> what <eol> I xxxxxxx to xx the # most xxxxxxxxx change <eol> that needed in ways of xxxxxxx

But # the # <eob> question is: <eob> In # order # <eob> to # get there, <eol> are xx # willing to <eob> # xxxx up? <eob>
A # few years ago, I was working xxxx x # bank <eol> that wanted to # embark a digital transformation.
wanted their offering to be # <eol> intuitive, more relevant. <eob>
Now, I'm xxx sure <eob> how many of you # a <eob> # bank from the inside, <eob> so let me try to illustrate <eol> # xxxx traditional banks like.
You see lots # of people # suits <eob> taking elevators <eob> xx go <eol> to department, <eol> sitting with marketers, <eol> xxxxxxxxx with <eob> engineers, # <eob> etc. <eol>
You see meetings # 20 # people nothing gets
Great xxxxxx They end up <eob> PowerPoint parking xxxxx <eol>
xxx there are endless # <eob> handovers xxxxxxx <eol>
Getting # anything # done xxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
this # xxxx <eol> xxxx <eob> in to transform, would have xx # improve <eol> time to market <eob> by changing their ways xx working as well.
But xxxx <eob>
To # get inspiration, # xx xxxxxxx <eol> to xxx have x look companies <eol> that seem # to xx more innovative, <eob> like Google, Spotify, Zappos. <eol>
And remember how we <eob> xxxx # the halls <eob> at xxx xx these # companies in # <eob> December 2014, <eob> a xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob> and a xxxx # xx bankers.
We xxxx like xx a strange # land, <eob> surrounded <eob> # by beanbags and hoodies <eol> and smart, <eob> # creative <eob> xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So then we # asked, xxxx # is # your company <eol> organized?" <eob> And we xxxxxxxx <eol> to # <eol> get org # <eob> chart. <eob>
But instead, they used strange drawings <eob> with funny # names like # <eol> and # xxxxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> xx explain how xxxx were organized.
So then tried to # that <eol> # our own world. <eob>
We # xxxxxx "How many # people <eob> are xxxxxxx for you?" <eol> "It depends". <eol>
"Who <eob> you xxxxxx to?" <eol> depends".
xxxxxxx <eob> xx xxxx priorities?" <eob> xxx depends". <eob>
You can our surprise. <eol>
xx were # <eol> xxxxxx for what we thought xx the basic principles <eol> of organizations, <eob> and answer was, "It xxxxxxxxx
Now, over the # <eol> course # of that day, <eol> we gained <eob> understanding of # <eol>
They believed in xxx power <eob> of xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eol>
Their teams were like # mini-start-ups. <eob>
They xxx product people <eol> engineers in <eob> the same team <eob> so they could # design, build <eol> and # test <eob> ideas # with # xxxxxxxxx independently of xxxxxx <eob> in # the company.
xxxx # did <eol> not <eol> between xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They all the skills needed <eol> there in the team. <eol>
xxxx # at end of that day, <eol> xx had a <eob> to <eol> reflect xx what <eol> we # had learned. <eol>
And we started <eol> to # xxxx # their so # we already thinking xx how xx apply some # xx these # xxxxx a # bank. <eol>
then, <eob> one # of the hosts, <eob> guy # who <eob> # had not # said a word <eol> # all # <eob> he suddenly xxxxx <eol> xxx x see you like xxx model.
But I # have one for # you: <eob> What # are you to give xxxx <eob> we willing # to give up? <eol>
xxx <eob> not # xxxx # an answer immediately, xxx we <eob> # knew # xx was right. <eol>
Change is only about <eob> xxxxxxxxx the xxxx <eob> it's about giving <eob> some of old <eol> as well.
Now, over # <eob> the <eob> # past years, <eol> I worked with companies <eol> all # xxxx # the world <eol> to change their xxxx xx # working. <eol>
And clearly, every company <eob> has xxx skeptics <eol> about why this is xxxxx xx for them.
"Our # is more complex," or # have <eob> the xxxxxx # xx # like we xxxx or "Regulators just <eob> won't allow <eob> this in our # industry". <eol>
xxx <eol> for xxxx bank and also <eob> for the other companies <eob> xxxx x # have worked with <eob> change <eol> was possible. <eob>
a year, # <eob> we <eob> up old silos between # marketing, product, channels and xxx
Three # employees # were <eol> into 350 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # teams. <eol>
So instead of product people <eol> sitting just with # people <eob> engineers <eob> engineers, <eol> x product <eol> # <eol> person and an engineer <eob> xxxx now xxxxxxx <eob> of xxx xxxxx
You could be a xxxxxx of a <eol> team responsible for account opening <eol> or for xxx mobile # banking app, xxxx <eob>
At the go-live date <eol> of xxxx new organization, <eob> people were xxxxxxx hands for # very # xxxxx # time, <eol> only to find xxx xxxx been xxxxxxx two <eol> minutes xxxx from # each other <eob> but they # were sending each other xxxxxx <eol> and xxxxxx # reports for last 10 years. <eol>
You hear someone saying, <eol> "Ah, you're <eol> # the guy # that I <eob> xxxxxx chasing for answers". <eob>
But now, xxxxxx coffee <eob> xxxxxxxx every <eob>
If the product guy has an idea, <eol> he can just # raise # it to get input from the engineer <eob> xxx # <eol> is # sitting right next # to him.
They xxxxxx test <eol> with customers immediately <eob> # -- <eol> xx xxxxxxxxxx no PowerPoints, # no xxx tape, <eol> just xxxxxxx stuff <eob>
# getting there is not # easy. <eob>
And # it # turns out, are # you willing to give up?" <eol> is # exactly # right # to xxxx
Autonomous decision-making <eob> requires multidisciplinary # teams. <eob>
xxxxxxx # of going <eob> up xxx # down the xxxxxxxxxxxxx xx want # xxx team to # decide.
xx do we need <eob> xxx the <eol> skills <eol> and for <eol> xxxx <eob> in # the team. <eob>
And this brings trade-offs.
Can we xxxxxxxxxx co-locate our # <eob> who are working # in different xxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxx or even <eol> different xxxxxxxxx <eob> # today? <eol>
xx should we <eol> invest in better videoconferencing? <eol>
how do # we <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> in the way xx # things across # xxxxxx <eob>
We still need some xxxx <eol> of management xxxxxxx <eol>
# these changes to structure <eob> and process procedure -- <eol> they <eol> xxx easy. <eob>
But in the end, x found the most difficult thing to change <eol> is our own behavior.
Let xx try to illustrate. <eol>
If we # <eob> these teams to be fast, flexible, <eol> creative, like mini-start-up, <eob> they have # <eob> to be # empowered xxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
But this <eol> xxxxx xx # xxxxxx # have xxxxxxx <eob> commanding their people xxxx to do, <eob> when to # do, <eob> # how # xxx <eob>
No micromanagers. <eol>
But # it also <eob> # each employee <eob> needs to become leader, regardless xx xxxxx # xxxxxx title. <eob>
It's # about all of # us up <eol> to take xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now obviously, we also cannot <eob> afford <eob> to have all # teams <eob> xxxxxxx in different xxxxxxxxxxx because # that <eob> would certainly lead # to chaos. <eob>
# we <eob> need <eob> and # autonomy <eob> at # same <eob> just <eob> xxxx a flock # <eob> of birds.
In # organizational xxxxxxxx <eol> this requires <eob> new behaviors, <eol> and # each new behavior, <eol> there xx <eol> on something as # well. <eob>
Leaders have to # <eob> make sure <eol> xxxx everyone # in xxx organization <eob> is <eol> aligned around the overall purpose the why <eob> and the -- what.
But # then xxxx xxxx let go <eob> # trust their # teams <eob> to the xxxxx decisions <eol> xx to get # there. <eob>
Now, creating <eob> alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> communication.
But you know # how say that information <eob> is a source <eob> of xxxxxx <eob>
Well, for some <eol> managers, xxxxxxx information may <eob> feel as # if they're giving up xxxx <eob> power. <eob>
xxx it's # not just managers.
The teams <eob> need to communicate <eol> openly and <eob> transparently as well. <eol>
these # the # <eol> xxxxx <eob> typically work in short # <eol> sprints, and at the end # # sprint, <eob> they organize # a demo session <eol> xx share <eob> # the output <eob> of # what they've done, transparently. <eob>
xxxx <eol> each member of the xxxxx an xxxxxx <eob> what they xxx working xx
Now, all this transparency <eol> be uncomfortable xxx people, <eob> # xxxxxxxxx there # <eob> is xx place # to xxxx anymore. <eob>
Everything xx # do xx transparent for everyone. <eob>
So, # alignment # is not easy, xxx providing xxxxxxxx <eol> is <eol> not so obvious, <eob> either. <eol>
One executive # at # another company <eol> to <eob> explain he used to be <eob> a master of milestone-tracking. <eol>
Now, today, to know how # xxxxxx are xxxxxx <eob> instead of looking at # status reports, <eob> he xxxxx walk # xxxx xx # <eob> the team floors <eol> attend one of <eob> their sessions. <eol>
xxx instead <eob> of # telling people what xx <eol> looks # ways # to help them. <eob>
is radical change <eob> for # someone # who used # xx <eol> be <eol> master of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in the old world, this executive said, "I only had the xxxxxxxx of control. <eob>
In xxxxxxxx many # projects would run over time and over budget, anyway. <eol>
xxx I have # more # transparency, <eob> I can course-correct <eol> much # earlier if needed". <eob>
And managers need <eob> to # change as well.
First # of all, the handovers <eob> and the PowerPoint, <eob> less xx a need for middle xxxxxxxxx <eob>
And in world, # there was <eob> this idea of thinkers and #
Employees would # follow # xxxxxxx
xxx instead xx only <eob> managing other # people, <eol> middle # managers were expected <eol> to player-coaches.
So # imagine, xxx the last 10 years, you have just been other people what to xxx <eob> but <eob> now <eob> xxxxxx expected to # # # again. <eol>
Clearly, this model is not <eol> for everyone, and great people <eob> # leave the # company.
the result is a new # xxxxxxx <eol> with less hierarchy. <eob>
xxx of this is <eol> hard
xxx # it's worth it.
xxx companies that I <eol> were xxxxxxxxx <eob> new <eob> # features # few times <eob>
xxx they have releases every few # <eob> # without # xxxxxxxxx <eob> the xxx tape, whole xxxxxxxxxxxx becomes more efficient.
And # if you walk the # <eol> halls <eol> xx these today, <eob> you just feel a new energy. <eob>
It # feels as if you're # <eol> xxxxxxx <eob> the of x very large start-up. <eob>
Now, # to # be fair, <eob> these xxxxxxxxxx they # cannot xxxxx victory yet. <eol>
But at <eob> least with this new # model, <eob> they are much better prepared to # respond to <eol>
xxxxx is getting faster <eol> and more # xxxxxxxx <eob> so we # <eob> need # to reboot # our way of working. <eol>
And the xxxxxxx part that change <eol> is <eob> not # structure or process # and xxxx <eol> also not <eol> senior taking charge.
Leaders xx all of those in # the organization <eob> who embrace the change. <eol>
all have # to lead the # change.
# the <eob> question xxx <eob> What are you willing to give #

xx long as they can find good # Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't xxxx where are. <eob>
Our focus on # work <eob> didn't happen <eob> accidentally. <eol>
It was a conscious choice <eob> from the very # beginning.
Notice x don't <eol> xxx xxx word # "remote," <eob> because it sets up the expectation, <eob> xxxx some are <eob> essential <eob> and <eol> some aren't. <eob>
use xxx word "distributed" xxxxxxxx # what we do, where everyone xx <eob> on # xxxxxxx field. <eob>
I think a # distributed workforce is # most effective xxx to # company. <eol>
The key is you have to <eol> # consciously. <eob>
When we xxxxxxx WordPress, <eob> many of # xxx first # 20 # hires <eol> xxxx people xxx never met # # <eob>
But # we'd <eol> collaborated # <eob> xxx years. <eob>
I # wanted to continue <eol> xxxx for one <eol> # reason. <eob>
I <eob> believe # that talent and are equally distributed <eob> the world. <eol> is # not. <eob>
In <eol> the <eol> tech xxxxxxxxx fish <eob> xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> the # same <eob> # small or xxxx <eol>
A # distributed # company <eol> xxx fish <eol> from # the entire ocean.
xxxxxxx of # hiring # someone # who # grew up in xxxxx # but <eob> lives in California, # can gain someone who xxxxxx works, wakes up and <eob> goes to sleep wherever they are xx # world. They bring a # understanding # of xxxx # culture <eol> and # a different lived experience.
At the base of xxx decision <eob> go distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people autonomy <eol> over # how # xxxx do their work. <eob>
Unless you're in a where xxxxxxxx # hours are # important, <eol> you can make your # own schedule. <eol>
Everyone have a xxxxxx office, xxxxx windows, the food they want <eob> to eat, you # can choose there's music <eob> xxx when <eob> silence. <eob>
You can # xxxxxx xxxx <eol> the xxxx <eol> should be. <eob>
You can save <eob> the time <eob> spend commuting <eob> and put xx into things that important xx <eol>
A # distributed workforce <eol> is ideal a # company. <eob>
xxx people xxxxx # xxx me, "This works for y'all, <eol> xxx xxxx about xxxxxxxx else?" <eob> If # xxx have # <eob> an # xxxxxxx <eob> xxx # do # few xxxxxx to # build distributed <eol>
First: document everything.
In xx <eob> it's easy <eol> to make # xxxxxxxxx in the # moment, <eol> in the <eob> kitchen, <eol> # in xxx <eob>
But if # people work remotely <eob> and some members of the team <eob> are having conversations <eol> they xxxxx xxxx access <eol> they'll these xxxxxxxxx being made <eol> without understanding the xxxx <eol>
Always leave x trail # of xxxxx you <eol> were <eol> and <eol> what xxx were thinking about. <eol>
This # allows <eob> others pick xx you # left <eob> off. <eol>
It # allows # people in xxxxxxxxx <eol> time zones xx xxxxxxxxx it's great to think <eol> as # an organization <eol> people <eob> and xxxxxx
have as much communication <eob> as possible xxxxxxx
xxxx # everything's and public, <eol> it allows <eob> # people up <eob>
You xxxx xxxx to find xxx #
There xxx so xxxx apps and xxxxxxxx <eob> that help # with day-to-day communication, <eob> xxxxx conferencing, <eob> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
The things # that changed how # you xxxx xxxxxxxx aren't objects # anymore. <eol>
They're things you <eob> access <eol> through your xxxxxxxxx <eol>
So xxxxxxxxxx <eol> with <eol> xxxxxxxxx tools that <eob> enable # collaboration, see what works.
Create productive, <eol> face-to-face # time. <eob>
In <eob> a xxxxxxxxxxx office, xxxxxx # in the xxxx place <eob> xx weeks out of the year <eol> and you # might <eol> three four # xxxxx apart.
We try to # flip # we # come together <eol> for short, intense bursts. <eol> a # year xx # do a grand <eol> # <eol> xxxxx xxx entire company <eob> comes for a week. <eob>
It's half-work, half-play.
The primary goal is people. xxxx to make sure <eol> everyone's aligned and <eob> on xxxx page, <eob> and xxxx xxxx <eob> # a deeper <eol> xxxx their # colleagues. <eob>
When they work # the rest xx the year, they can bring together that xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and empathy. <eol>
And the xxxxx <eob> practice: <eol> give people xxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xx their # own <eob> work environment.
Every person # at Automattic <eol> has a co-working stipend xxxx put <eol> towards a co-working # xxxxx <eol> or <eob> to buy so # they don't <eob> out of xxx coffee shop. <eob>
One # in Seattle <eol> xx pool their stipends together and rented a # on x xxxxxxx pier.
Each xxxxxx who # joins company <eob> gets x home-office stipend. <eol>
xxxx <eol> # is money can invest xxxxxxx <eol> xxx # <eob> right # chair, monitor, <eol> # right xxxx so # <eol> they can have <eol> the most <eol> productive environment # <eob> xxx them. <eob>
Today, there are just a # few <eol> xxxxxxxxx <eol> that distributed xxxxxx
In a decade or <eob> # xxxx x predict that 90 percent of companies <eol> that are to be # <eob> changing the # course of xxx xxxxx <eob> are going function way.
They will to be distributed # first, <eob> or # they'll # be replaced # xx xxxxx that are. <eob>
xx you xxxxx xxxxx what you're # going xx xxxxx next, consider xxx <eob> # you <eob> can tap into # global talent, give people # xxxxxxxx to # and work <eol> where they # feel they <eob> should <eob> and still # participate fully whatever <eob> it # is you're creating together.
