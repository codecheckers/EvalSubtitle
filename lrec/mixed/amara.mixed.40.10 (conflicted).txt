xxx kind # harassment xxxx women <eol> face # in Pakistan is very <eob> and leads xx sometimes <eol>
This kind of harassment # women <eol> xxxx internet -- <eob> essentially, # xxxxxxxxxx <eol>
It's a xxxx xx oppression. <eob>
Pakistan is the sixth xxxx populous <eol> country xx the world, <eob> with xxx # million people having access <eol> to mobile technologies, <eob> and 15 xxxxxxx internet # penetration. <eob>
this number seem # xx # go down <eol> with xxx rise of xxx technologies. <eob>
Pakistan xx xxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> xx the youngest xxxxx Peace # Prize <eob> Malala <eob>
But that's xxxx # one # aspect of Pakistan. <eob>
# aspect is where <eol> the twisted # concept of xxxxx is # linked xx women and their # <eob> where men are # # to disrespect # women <eob> and even kill xxxx sometimes <eob> xx xxx name # of so-called xxxxxxx honor"; <eob> xxxxx # left to die <eol> xxxxx # their houses for to a man on a # mobile phone, <eob> in the name # of # "family honor". <eob>
Let me say xxxx very # <eob> not honor; <eob> a xxxxxxxxxxxx murder. <eob>
I come from a xxxx xxxxx village <eol> in xxxxxxx Pakistan, <eob> where women are xxx <eob> # allowed <eol> their higher education. <eob>
The elders of my extended family <eol> allow their # xxxxx <eob> to pursue their # higher <eol> or their professional # careers. <eob>
unlike the other <eol> male <eol> guardians xx family, <eob> my father # was one xxx really <eol> supported my <eol>
To # get my law degree, <eob> of it xxx # really difficult, <eob> xxx xxxxxx frowns of xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
But in the end, I knew <eol> it's # either me or them, and x xxxxx # myself. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
My traditions <eol> xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxx for a xxxxx <eob> wouldn't allow me to # own # a mobile <eol> phone until I was married. <eob>
And xxxx when I was # married, <eob> this # tool xxxxxx # a tool <eol> for my own <eol> surveillance. <eob>
When # this idea <eol> xx # being surveilled by # my ex-husband, <eob> he didn't approve of <eob> and threw # out # xx his xxxxxx <eob> along xxxx # my six-month-old <eol> xxxx # Abdullah. <eob>
And that was the time <eol> I # xxxxx # asked xxxxxxx <eob>
Why # are women xxx allowed <eol> to enjoy xxx # rights <eob> enshrined # in our xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
While the law that a # has # the xxxx # equal access <eob> to # information, <eol> is it always # men xx brothers, <eol> xxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx <eob> who are granting these # to <eob> effectively xxxxxx the law irrelevant?" <eob>
So I # decided # to take a step, <eob> instead # of # keep # <eol> these patriarchal # structures <eob> and # societal <eob>
xxx I founded the Digital Rights <eol> Foundation # in 2012 <eob> to address # all xxx <eol> and women's experiences xx online <eob> and cyberharassment. <eob>
From lobbying for free and <eob> convincing young women <eob> access # to the safe internet <eol> is # their fundamental, human right, <eob> I'm trying # xx # play part <eol> in igniting the # spark <eob> to address the xxxxxxxxx <eol> that have me all these # years. <eob>
x hope in my # heart, <eob> and to offer a solution to this xxxxxxx <eob> I started Pakistan's # the xxxxxxxx <eol> first cyberharassment # help line <eob> in December 2016 # <eob> (Applause) <eob>
to xx support to women <eol> xx not # know who xx xx <eob> when # face serious xxxxxxx <eob>

Let's xx xxxx to 1975. <eob>
Yep, this is <eob> me. <eob>
I've got a lot to # learn, <eol> a computer xxxxxxxxx <eob> I've got # long hair, <eob> I'm working under Andy <eob> who's xxxx xxxxxx the manager <eob> of his or # any other <eob>
Andy was a leader <eol> and also # <eob> and he said to me, <eol> it xxxxxx # doesn't what # xxx xxxxx <eol>
Execution # is what # matters the most". <eob>
so Andy xxxxxxxx x system <eol> called # "Objectives and Key Results". <eob>
It xxxx # of rolls off <eol> the # xxxxxxx doesn't it? <eob>
And it's all xxxxx # excellent # execution. <eob>
So here's a classic # from the 1970s <eob> of xxxxxxxxx Andy Grove.
xxxxxxx Grove: The two xxx # <eol> the management # by # objective xxxxxxx <eob> are the objectives and the key results, <eol> they # match <eol> # the xxx <eob>
The # objective <eob> the direction. <eob>
The # key # have xx be measured, <eob> but at the end you xxx look <eol> and xxxxxxx any say, I do that, or # did I not # do <eob> xxxx Simple. <eob>
John xxxxxx That's xxxxx <eob>
No. <eob>
# and Key Results, <eob> or OKRs, <eob> xxx a xxxxxx goal-setting xxxxxx <eob> and xxxx work for # organizations, <eol> they work # for xxxxxx <eob> they # xxxx work xxx individuals. <eob>
The xxxxxxxxxx are what <eol> want to # have accomplished. <eob>
The key results are how <eol> I'm going get that # <eob>
Objectives. xxx results. <eob>
What and <eob>
But <eol> here's the truth: <eob> many # of us are xxxxxxx xxxxx <eob> # most xx # us <eol> are setting goals at all. <eob>
A # of xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> set and them. <eob>
their sales, introduce their xxx products, <eob> make their numbers, <eob> but lack a sense of <eol> inspire their teams. <eob>
So how <eob> do you set <eol> these # right way? <eob>
First, you must <eol> xxx question, # "Why?" <eob> Why? <eob>
Because # transformational teams <eob> combine their <eol> to their and to their # purpose, <eob> and # they develop a # clear <eol> and compelling sense # xx why. <eob>
I want you a xxxxxx <eol>

xxxx two years <eol> into the company's <eol> # life, <eob> federal government # issued proposal <eob> to build the first ever <eol> cloud database Medicaid. <eob>
xxxx # you'll remember <eol> xxxx # Medicaid is that program <eob> that serves million # Americans, <eob> our xxxxx our children <eob> xxx people with xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>

She jumped the xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> She did flinch. <eob>

Well, a why. <eob>
Jini's xxxxxxx brother Kimong

Every row of data is a life <eob> whose # xxxxx <eol> to be # told with dignity. <eob>
JD: And Jini's # story tells us <eob> that x compelling # sense # xxx <eol> can be # the launchpad xxx xxx <eob>
Remember, # that's what <eol> we want to have <eob>
And xxxxxxxxxx # are significant, <eob> they're action-oriented, <eob> inspiring, <eob> xxx they're a # # vaccine <eol> against fuzzy thinking. <eob>
You think rockstar <eob> would # be an unlikely user <eol> of Objectives and Key # xxxxxxxx <eob> but xxx xxxxxx Bono # has xxxx xxxx <eob> wage a global # war <eol> against poverty # and disease, <eob> xxx his <eol> # ONE organization <eol> xxxxxxx # on two xxxxxx gorgeous, <eob> audacious objectives. <eob>
The first is relief <eob> xxx the poorest xxxxxxxxx in # the world. <eob>
The is universal access <eol> to anti-HIV # drugs.
Now, why are xxxxx good objectives? <eob>
Let's go xxxx to xxx checklist. <eob>
Concrete? <eob>
Yes. <eob>
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Well, let's listen xx Bono. <eob>
So passionate? <eob>
How passionate? <eob>
What actions does # xxxx passion <eol> lead # you do? <eob>
If xxx xxxxx doesn't # find <eol> perfect rhyme with head, then your means nothing. <eob>
The OKR framework cultivates the madness, <eob> the contained inside xxx <eob>
xx xxxxx us # an # environment for risk, <eob> for trust, <eob> where failing is a # fireable offense. <eob>
And when you # sort <eol> of and xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> the right people, <eob> magic is around the corner. <eob>
JD: # I love xxxxx <eob>
OKRs cultivate the madness, <eob> and magic # is right xxxxxx the # corner. <eob>
xxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
So with xxxx we've xxxxxxx xxx whys, <eob> with # Bono xxx # of # goal-setting. <eob>
Let's turn # our to # the hows. <eob>
xxxxxxxxx the # the key results. That's xxx we meet # our objectives. <eol>
And good results <eol> are xxxxxxxx and time-bound. <eob>
They're aggressive but realistic. <eob>
They're measurable, <eol> and they're <eob>
Those # are xxxx key # results.
In xxxxx # I xxxxxxxxxx OKRs <eol> xx Google's # xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> Larry xxx xxxxxxx <eob>

Well, not <eob>
What he really said # was, <eob> "We don't have any # other <eol> to manage this <eob> so xxxxx xxxx it x go". <eob> (Laughter)
And I took # xxxx as kind # of endorsement. <eob>
But quarter since then, <eob> every Googler has # written xxxx <eol> and her key results. <eob>
They've xxxxxx them, <eob> and they've # them <eol> for xxxxxxxx to see. <eob>
And not used <eol> xxxxxxx # or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
They're set # xxxxxx <eob>
They're # used for a # higher xxxxxxxx <eob> and # that's get collective commitment <eob> to truly xxxxxxx goals. <eob>
In # 2008, a Googler, Sundar xxxxxxx <eol> on an objective <eob> xxxxx was to # <eol> the next xxxxxx <eob> for # xxxxxx of web applications <eob> in other words, xxxxx the best browser. <eob>
He was xxxx thoughtful <eol> about how xx chose xxx # results. <eob>
How do you measure the best browser? <eob>
It could # be # xx clicks xx engagement. <eob>
No. # He said: numbers # of users, <eob> because users are xxxxx # to decide <eob> if # xxxxxx is # browser or <eob>
So xx xxx this one <eol> objective: <eol> build best xxxxxxxx <eob>
And # every year <eol> he stuck the same key results, <eob> xx but xx # upped <eob>
In xxx # first year, <eol> his goal was # 20 # million # users <eob> and # he it. <eob>
xxx less <eob>
Second year, he xxxxxx <eol> the # bar to 50 million. <eob>
He got # to 37 million xxxxxx <eob>
Somewhat better. <eob>
In the third <eob> xx upped # the # ante once # more <eol> xx a hundred xxxxxxxx <eob>
He launched an # aggressive <eol> marketing # campaign, <eob> broader <eol> improved xxx technology, # and kaboom! <eob>
He got 111 million <eob>
Here's # why I like xxxx story, <eob> not so much # for the xxxxx ending, <eob> xx shows someone <eol> carefully choosing the right objective <eob> and # xxxx # sticking to # it <eol> year after year. <eob>
It's # a perfect story for # a nerd xxxx me. <eob>
I # think of OKRs <eol> xx # xxxxxxxxxxx # vessels <eob> that are made from # the whats <eol> hows of # <eob>

That's why we do our xxxxx <eob>
OKRs # are not # a silver bullet. <eob>
They're not going to be <eol> a substitute for x xxxxxx culture <eob> or for # stronger <eob> those # xxxxxxxxxxxx # in place, <eol> they # xxx xxxx you to the # mountaintop. <eob>
I # want you # think <eol> about # your # life # for a moment. <eob>
Do xxx # have the right metrics? <eob>
Take # time to write xxxx your values, <eob> your objectives xxx key <eob>

What history? <eob>
It is something written xx the <eol>
There # is <eob> a <eob> that history <eol> should be focused # on # the rulers, <eob> like Lenin # or Trotsky. <eob>
As a people <eol> many countries, like xxxxx Russia, <eob> look at history as something <eob> xxxx was predetermined <eob> or determined by xxx # <eob> and common people could <eol> influence it in any way. <eob>
Many # Russians today do xxx believe <eol> that Russia # could ever xxxx <eol> or ever will a # truly xxxxxxxxxx nation, <eob> xxxx is due to way <eol> history has <eob> been framed <eob> to the citizens of Russia. <eob>
And this is # xxxxx <eob>
prove <eob> # spent two years <eol> my # life # trying # go 100 years back, <eob> to the year xxxxx <eob> the year of the Russian xxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
x asked myself, what if # the # internet <eol> and xxxxxxxx 100 years ago? <eob>
So last year, we <eob> a social for dead people, <eob> named Project1917.com. <eob>
My team xxx x created our software, <eob> digitized and <eol> all # real diaries <eob> # # letters <eob> by more than 3,000 <eob> 100 years # xxxx <eob>
So # any xxxx of our website or xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> can follow x news # feed <eol> for each # day # of 1917 <eob> and # read people <eol> Stravinsky or Trotsky, <eob> Lenin or Pavlova <eol> others thought xxx # felt. <eob>
We watch all # those <eol> being # ordinary # xxxxxx # you # and <eob> not demigods, <eob> and xx see that history consists <eol> # mistakes, # fears, weaknesses, not only "genius xxxxxxx <eob>
project # a shock for many <eob> who used to think that our country <eob> has always # been autocratic # empire <eob> # xxxxx xx freedom xxx democracy <eol> could # never have prevailed, <eob> just because democracy <eol> was our <eol>
if we take # x # broader # look, <eob> it's not black and white. <eob>
1917 led # to xx xxxxx <eol> of # communist dictatorship. <eob>
xxxx # this we xxx # that Russia <eol> have had a # different history <eob> and a democratic future, <eol> any country xxxxx # still # can. <eob>
Reading xxx from 1917, <eob> xxx learn that # xxxxxx <eol> xxx country # xx the world <eob> to death # penalty, <eob> or the ones <eol> xx grant # women voting # rights. <eob>
Knowing history and xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> how ordinary people influenced history <eob> can help us # create better xxxxxxx <eob> because history is just # rehearsal of happening right now. <eob>
We # # need ways of telling history, <eob> and xxxx # year, for example, <eob> xx started a new # online xxxxxxx <eol> is <eol> # called 1968Digital.com, and that is online # documentary series <eob> that gives you xxxxxxxxxx <eol> of that year, 1968, <eob> x # # by xxxxxx xxxxxx <eob> that, in ways, <eol> created xxx xxxxx as we # xxxx it xxxx <eob>
But we making that # <eob> imagining what if xxx the xxxx <eol> characters xxxxx # xxx mobile xxxxxx ... <eob> just like that? <eob>
And we # see that x # xxx of individuals <eol> were facing the same # challenges <eol> and # for # the same # values, <eob> no # matter if they lived <eol> in the US or in # USSR <eob> in # France or in China <eol> or <eob> in Czechoslovakia. <eob>
xx exposing # xxxxxxx <eob> xx such # a # way, <eob> through social <eob> we show that people in power <eol> xxx # not the xxxx # xxxx # xxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob>
That gives any # a possibility <eol> of reclaiming history. <eob>
Ordinary # people matter. <eob>
They # have an # impact. <eob>

Journalists, scientists, <eol> philosophers matter. <eol>
We shape society. <eob>

Computer # # today <eob> are xxxxxxxxxx # incredible tasks <eob> with xxxx accuracies, at # a massive <eol> using human-like intelligence.
And # this # intelligence of <eol> is often # referred to as AI <eob> or # artificial xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
AI is poised to an incredible <eol> xx our lives in the future. <eob>
Today, xxxxxxxx <eob> xx still # # massive challenges <eob> in detecting # xxx diagnosing <eol> xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx # illnesses, <eob> such # as infectious diseases and cancer. <eob>
Thousands of patients # every # <eob> lose their lives <eol> due # liver and oral # cancer. <eob>
Our best # way to xxxx these <eol> is to xxxxxxx early detection <eol> and of these diseases. <eob>
So how xx we detect these diseases today, <eol> and can artificial # intelligence help? <eob>
patients who, unfortunately, <eol> are suspected of # these diseases, <eob> an expert physician # xxxxx orders <eob> very expensive <eol> xxxxxxx imaging technologies <eob> such as # imaging, <eol> xxxx xx be performed. <eob>
Once those images are collected, <eob> another expert physician then # xxxxxxxxx <eol> images and talks xx the # patient. <eob>
As you can xxxx this is <eol> a very resource-intensive # process, <eob> requiring both expert xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> expensive medical # imaging technologies, <eob> and xx # not considered xxxxxxxxx <eol> for the # developing # world. <eob>
And # in many <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxxx nations, as well. <eob>
can we this problem <eol> artificial intelligence? <eob>
Today, if I to use traditional artificial # intelligence architectures <eob> to solve problem, <eob> # would require 10,000 # -- <eob> I xxxxxxx on an order of xxxxxx <eol> xxxx # expensive xxxxxxx xxxxxx <eob> first to be generated. <eob>
After that, I then go <eol> to an # xxxxxx physician, <eob> who analyze <eol> those # for <eob>
using those two pieces of information, <eob> x can train a standard xxxx neural # network <eol> xx # deep # learning network to # provide diagnosis. <eob>
xx # approach, <eob> traditional artificial <eol> intelligence approaches <eob> from same problem. <eob>
Large # amounts of xxxxx expert physicians <eol> and expert # xxxxxxx imaging xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
So, xxx we invent more xxxxxxxxx <eob> and more xxxxxxxx artificial <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx # architectures <eob> to solve these very important <eol> problems # us today? <eob>
xxx # this is xxxxxxx <eol> xxxx # my # at Media Lab # does. <eob>
We have invented a variety <eol> of # AI architectures <eob> to xxxxx some of the important <eol> challenges facing # <eob> xxxxx <eob> in medical clinical # trials. <eob>
the example I <eol> with you today, we had # two # goals. <eob>
first goal was to reduce <eol> xxx # number xx images <eob> required to train <eol> artificial intelligence # <eob>
Our second goal -- we xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxx <eob> we wanted # to reduce the xxx <eol> of expensive # medical imaging technologies <eob> to screen # patients. <eob>
So <eob> how did we do # it? <eob>
For # first goal, <eob> xxxxxxx of starting <eol> with tens # and # thousands <eob> of these very xxxxxxxxx medical images, <eol> like traditional # AI, <eob> we with a # single medical # xxxxxx <eob>
From this my team and I <eol> figured # out x very clever <eob> to extract billions <eol> of # xxxxxxxxxxx packets. <eob>
xxxxx packets <eol> included colors, xxxxxxx # geometry <eob> and rendering of the disease <eol> on xxxxxx
In x sense, we converted one image <eol> xxxx billions training xxxx <eob> massively the amount xx xxxx <eol> for # <eob>
For # our # second <eob> to reduce # the use of expensive xxxxxxx <eol> imaging xxxxxxxxxxxx # screen xxxxxxxxx <eob> we started with a standard, <eol> white photograph, <eob> acquired either # x camera <eol> or a mobile # phone, for the patient. <eob>
Then <eol> xxxxxxxx # of xxxxxxxxxxx packets? <eob>
We # from <eol> medical onto xxxx image, <eob> creating # xxxxxxxxx <eol> that we call a # image. <eob>
Much to our xxxxxxxxx <eol> xx only # xxxxxxxx 50 -- <eob> I repeat, only # 50 # -- <eob> xx these xxxxxx to xxxxx <eol> our # algorithms xxxx # efficiencies. <eob>
To summarize # xxx approach, <eob> xxxxxxx using 10,000 <eol> xxxx expensive medical images, <eob> # can # train # the AI algorithms <eol> in an # <eob> using # only xx of these high-resolution, <eol> but standard photographs, <eob> xxxxxxxx from DSLR cameras <eol> # mobile phones, <eob> xxxxxxx diagnosis. <eob>
More importantly, <eob> our xxxxxxxxxx can xxxxxxx <eol> in the future # and even # right now, <eob> some simple, # white light photographs from xxx patient, <eob> instead of # expensive <eol> medical xxxxxxx technologies. <eob>
x believe # that we poised <eol> to enter an # era <eob> where artificial xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> is going to make # an incredible <eol> impact on xxx <eob>
And I think that thinking <eol> about # traditional AI, <eob> <eob> we should also continue thinking <eob> about unorthodox <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx architectures, <eob> which xxx accept small amounts # of <eob> xxx # xxxxx xxxx of # the most important <eol> problems facing xx today, <eob> especially in health care. <eob>

So in case, <eob> # the cells # rushing towards infection to xxxxx # bacteria, <eob> they're xxxxxxx toward an # injury. <eob>
I discovered a # specific <eol> xxxx of immune cell, <eob> the helper # cell, <eol> was present # inside <eol> that material that I # implanted <eob> and absolutely critical xxx wound xxxxxxxx <eob>
just like xxxx you were # a kid <eol> and you'd break your xxxxxx <eob> and # try # xxx # tape it back together again, <eob> we # <eob> but # it xxxxx not be <eol> # most functional xxxx <eob> and we'll xxx # scar. <eob>
if we don't have these helper # cells, <eob> instead xx xxxxxxx muscle, <eob> our muscle # develops <eol> fat cells inside of # it, <eob> # if xxxxxxx # fat in our muscle, <eol> it xxxxx as # strong. <eob>
# using xxx immune system, <eob> xxx xxxx could grow <eol> back <eol> xxxxx scars <eob> and # look like what it # was <eol> xxxxxx we injured. <eob>
xxx working # to create materials <eob> that give us # the signals <eol> to build new tissue <eob> by changing the # immune <eob>
We # know that any time <eol> a is implanted our body, <eob> the immune system will it.
This ranges xxxx <eol> to # insulin <eob> pumps <eob> to the that engineers are xxxxx <eol> to xxx # build tissue. <eob>
So I place that or scaffold, in the body, <eob> the immune # creates <eol> x xxxxx environment of # xxxxx and # proteins <eob> that xxx change the way <eol> that our cells # behave. <eob>
Now, just like the weather <eol> affects our # xxxxx activities, like # xxxxx for a run <eob> or xxxxxxx # inside and binge-watching <eol> an # entire xx on Netflix, <eob> the environment # a scaffold <eob> affects the # way that <eol> our stem cells grow and develop. <eob>
If we # have # wrong signals, <eob> say Netflix signals, <eob> we # get fat cells instead # muscle. <eob>
These scaffolds are made <eol> a variety of different things, <eob> from plastics to naturally <eol> xxxxxxx materials, <eob> nanofibers # varying # thicknesses, <eob> sponges xxx more or less porous, <eol> of # different stiffnesses. <eob>
And researchers <eol> can # even xxxx the materials <eob> different signals over time. <eob>
xx in # words, we can orchestrate <eol> this # show of cells <eob> by giving them the correct <eol> stage, xxxx and props <eob> that be changed for different xxxxxxxx <eob> like a xxxxxxxx <eob> xxxxx the # set <eob> xxx "Les xxxxxx <eol> "Little # Shop of Horrors". <eob>
I'm xxxxxxxxx types of signals <eob> that mimic how our # body xxxxxxxx xx # injury <eol> to # help us regenerate. <eob>
In the xxxxxxx xx see <eol> a scar-proof <eob> a moldable filler <eob> xx xxxx a wound-healing vaccine. <eob>
Now, xxxxxx going to # wake up # xxxxxxxx <eol> able <eob> to like xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
not next Tuesday, either. <eob>
But # with these advances, <eob> and working with # xxxxxx <eol> to help tissue <eob> and heal wounds, <eob> xx could <eol> begin seeing <eol> products xxx market <eob> that work with our body's # defense system <eol> to help us regenerate, <eob> and maybe one # day able <eol> to keep # with salamander. <eob>
Thank you. <eob>
<eob>
So, as a child, <eob> I # to # all xx xx <eol> at my great-grandmother's xxxxxx <eob>
humid, summer days, <eol> I xxxxx dash across the floor <eob> and stick face # in of <eol> # only air conditioner. <eob>
But # I didn't realize <eol> that that simple experience, <eob> though brief, <eob> was a privileged one # our # community. <eob>
Growing xxx stories xxxxxxxxx neighbors <eol> having xx xxx fake energy <eob> # accounts <eob> xx to # steal xxxxxx <eob> seemed xxxxxx to me. <eob>
xxxxxx the winter, struggling to warm, <eob> my # neighbors would xx choice <eol> but to bypass # the xxxxx <eob> after # their heat was shut # off, <eob> to keep # xxxxxx <eol> # one more day. <eob>
These kinds # of dangerous <eol> xxxxxxxxx can take root <eob> # # are faced <eol> impossible choices. <eob>
In US, the xxxxxxx American spends <eol> three percent of their income xx energy. <eob>
In # contrast, low-income <eol> and rural populations <eob> can spend 20, xxxx 30 percent <eol> of xxxxx income xx energy. <eob>
In 2015, # this caused xxxx <eol> 25 million people to xxxx xxxxx <eob> to # provide power to their homes. <eob>
This is energy becomes a xxxxxxx <eob>
But energy burdens # are much more <eol> than # a number. <eob>
They # xxxxxxx impossible and perilous choices: <eob> Do # take your child <eol> xxx her medicine, <eob> xx xx you feed her? <eob>
Or do xxx keep her # warm? <eob>
xxxx an xxxxxxxxxx # choice, <eob> xxx nearly every xxxxxx <eob> seven million people <eol> between medicine energy. <eob>
This a xxxx larger <eol> and systemic <eob>
Families with high energy burdens <eol> are disproportionately people of color, <eob> spend per # square foot <eol> than their # white counterparts. <eob>
But it's also nurses, veterans <eol> and even schoolteachers <eob> who fall into the mass <eol> of 37 # million people a year <eob> are unable to energy <eol> xxx most basic needs. <eob>
As x result, those with <eob> energy xxxxxxx <eob> have a # xxxxxxx <eol> of conditions <eol> like # xxxxx xxxxxxx and xxxxxxx <eob>
Look -- given xxx rockets to Mars <eol> xxx # pocket-sized AI, <eob> we xxxx # tools # to <eol> these systemic inequities. <eob>
The technology is # here. <eob>
Cost xx # renewables, insulation, <eol> microgrids and smart home technology <eob> xxx all decreasing. <eob>
However, # xxxx xx # # cost parity, <eob> xxx majority # xx those who own # solar <eol> earn much more # the # xxxxxxxxx <eob>
This # is why, when x xxx 22, <eol> I founded the nonprofit <eob>
Our mission is alleviate energy # <eol> xx working with communities, <eob> utilities xxx government # agencies xxxxx <eob> to provide equitable xxxxxx <eol> xx clean energy, <eob> energy efficiency and xxxxxx technology. <eob>
xxx xxxxxxx no one way solve this. <eob>
x believe in the power <eol> of local communities, <eob> in the transforming effect <eol> of relationships.
So # we start by working <eol> with the # communities <eob> that # the xxxxxxx energy burdens. <eob>
# host # workshops <eol> and # for communities <eob> to learn about energy poverty, <eob> and how even small <eol> updates their # homes <eob> like better insulation for windows <eol> and water heaters <eob> can go x xxxx way to maximize efficiency. <eob>
We're connecting neighborhoods <eol> to solar <eob> and spearheading community-led <eol> smart home research <eob> and programs <eob> to help families bring # xxxxx energy bills. <eob>
xxxxx even working directly <eol> with elected officials, <eob> advocating for more # equitable <eob> because to see this vision <eol> of xxxxxx xxxxxx # resilience succeed, <eob> we have # to # xxxx together sustainably. <eob>
Now, US spends <eol> three billion a # year <eob> on energy bill payment assistance. <eob>
these programs do # help <eol> xxxxxxxx # people, <eob> but they're only able xx xxxx <eol> a # of those # in need. <eob>
In fact, <eob> there is a <eol> home-energy affordability <eob> so xxxxxxxxxx alone # is not sustainable. <eob>
xxx by xxxxxxxx xxxxxx equity <eol> xxx resilience into our <eob> xx can xxxxxx fair and access <eob> to energy that is <eol> reliable and # affordable. <eob>
At # microgrid technology, <eol> clean technology and energy <eol> dramatically # xxxxxxx public health. <eob>
And for # with high energy # burdens, <eob> xx xxx help them reclaim <eol> 20 percent xx their income xx <eob> 20 of x person's xxxxxx <eol> who's struggling to make xxxx meet. <eob>
This is <eob>
is an # opportunity <eol> for families to their energy savings <eob> to sponsor future. <eob>
I think xxxx to my great-grandmother <eol> xxx her neighbors, <eob> the impossible choices <eol> that xxxx had to make <eob> and effect it <eol> on our whole # community. <eob>
But this not just about them. <eob>
are millions nationwide <eol> to the same # impossible choices today. <eob>
And xxxxxx # <eol> are barrier <eol> to # overcome, <eob> xxx through # relationships <eol> communities and technology, <eob> we the paths to overcome them.
And when we do, <eob> xx all # be more resilient. <eob>
you. <eob>
<eob>
Have you ever watched <eol> flock of birds # work xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Thousands of animals, flying xx perfect synchrony: <eob> Isn't it fascinating?
I xxxx remarkable xx xxxx these birds <eol> would not to # do xxxx if # # xxxx <eol> xx follow xxx <eob>
Their # # <eol> would # <eob> simply be xxx <eob>
Instead, scientists believe <eol> that these xxxxx are aligned on <eob> few simple rules, <eob> allowing every bird <eol> xx make decisions <eob> while # still flying xx # # synchrony. <eob>
alignment enables xxxxx autonomy, <eob> and their xxxxxxxx <eol> makes them fast # <eob>
Now, what does # this have do <eol> with any one of us? <eob>
Well, it's # one way of <eol> I # most important change <eob> that is needed in ways of xxxxxxx today. <eob>
The world is getting faster <eol> and xxxx complex, <eob> xx xx # xxxx # a new way of # working, <eob> a # way # xxxxxxx <eol> around purpose, <eob> # takes out bureaucracy <eob> and # xxxx truly # empowers people <eol> make decisions faster. <eob>
xxx xxx # xxx <eob> In order to xxx there, <eob> what are we willing to <eob>
x # xxxxx ago, # I xxx working # with # a bank <eob> to embark xx a transformation. <eob>
They # wanted xxxxx offering be simpler, <eob> more intuitive, more xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, xxx not sure # how of you <eol> have # seen # a bank from the inside, <eob> so let # xx to illustrate <eol> what many traditional banks # look # like. <eob>
You xxx xxxx of in <eob> taking xxxxxxxxx to go <eol> xxxxx # department, <eob> marketers xxxxxxx marketers, <eol> xxxxxxxxx # with engineers, etc. <eob>
You # meetings xxxx 20 # people <eob> xxxxx nothing gets xxxxxxxx <eol>
Great ideas? # They up <eol> in # parking # <eob>
there are endless <eob> # xxxxxxxxx <eol> between # departments. <eob>
anything done can # take forever. <eob>
xx this xxxx knew <eol> xxxx in order to # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> they would have xx # improve <eol> their time market <eob> by drastically changing <eol> their of working as <eob>
But how? <eob>
To get some inspiration, we decided <eol> go # xxx have a look at <eob> that seem to be more xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> like xxxxxxx # xxxxxxxx Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
And I xxxxxxxx how we xxxx walking <eob> the halls at one of these companies <eob> in December xxxxx x management consultant <eol> and a team <eol> of bankers. <eob>
felt like in a land, <eob> surrounded by beanbags # hoodies <eob> and lots smart, creative # employees. <eol>
So we <eol> xxxx is your company organized?" <eob> And # we expected get # xx org chart. <eob>
But # xxxxxxxx # they used <eol> xxxxxxx drawings <eob> with names like "squads" <eol> and "chapters" "tribes" <eob> to # how they were
So then we tried # to translate <eol> to own # <eob>
# xxxx # xxxx xxxxxx are working for # xxxxx <eob> "It # depends". <eob>
"Who do you report to?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
decides on # your priorities?" <eob> "It depends". <eob>
xxx can imagine our surprise. <eob>
We xxxx # asking # for what we xxxxxxx <eol> were of the basic principles <eob> of <eob> and xxxxx answer was, "It depends". <eob>
Now, over the course of that day, <eob> # xxxxxx x better <eol> understanding of their model. <eob>
They believed in the power <eol> of small, autonomous <eob>
Their teams xxxx like mini-start-ups. <eob>
They had # product people <eol> and IT xxxxxxxxx xxx same # team <eob> so xxxx could design, build <eol> and test ideas with customers <eob> independently xx xxxxxx in the # company. <eob>
They # did not # # handovers <eol> between departments. <eob>
They had all the # skills # needed <eol> there in team. <eob>
the end xx that day, <eol> we xxx # a xxxxxxx <eob> to reflect on we learned. <eob>
And we had xxxxxxx to like their model, <eob> so we were <eob> already xxxxxxxx of how <eol> to apply some of xxxxx ideas to # a bank. <eob>
But then, of # <eol> x guy xxx # had # not said a word all <eob> he xxxxxxxx said, <eob> xxx I see you # like model. <eob>
xxx I <eob> xxxx one question for you: <eob> What xxx xxx willing # give up?" <eob> What xx willing to give # up? <eob>
We did xxx # have an immediately, <eol> but we knew # he was <eob>
# is xxx only about <eol> embracing the new; <eob> xxxxx up <eol> xx some of the # old # as well. <eob>
Now, over the # past years, <eob> I worked with companies <eol> all over world <eob> xx change their ways xx working. <eob>
And every # company <eol> has # their # skeptics <eob> about xxxx is not <eol> going to work xxx # them. <eob>
"Our product is more complex," <eob> or "They don't have <eol> the xxxxxx like # do," <eob> or "Regulators # just won't <eob> # allow this <eol> in our industry". <eob>
But for this bank also <eol> for the other companies <eob> that I have worked with afterwards, <eob> was xxxxxxxxx <eob>
Within # a year, xx completely <eol> blew # silos <eob> between # <eol> # channels and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees were reorganized <eol> into 350 multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
So instead # # product people <eol> just with xxxxxxx people <eob> and engineers # with <eob> product person xxx an engineer <eol> were now of the team. <eob>
xxx could be a member # of x team <eol> for xxxxxxx opening <eob> or # the mobile banking app, etc. <eob>
At the date <eol> new organization, <eob> some were shaking hands <eol> for the first time, <eob> # to find out that they had been <eol> sitting two away xxxx xxxx other <eob> but # they sending each other emails <eol> and status # reports for # xxx last 10 years. <eob>
You would xxxx someone saying, <eob> "Ah, so # you're guy # that # I <eol> was always chasing for answers". <eob> (Laughter) <eob>
But now, they're having coffee <eol> together every day. <eob>
the product guy has # an # idea, <eol> he can xxxx raise it <eob> to get input # from xxx engineer <eol> who is xxxxxxx # right next him. <eob>
They xxx decide to test <eol> xxxx customers xxxxxxxxxxx -- <eob> no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape, <eob> getting stuff # done.
Now, # getting there # is easy. <eob>
And as it xxxxx out, "What xxx you willing to # xxxx up?" <eob> is the # right question # to ask. <eob>
Autonomous # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> requires multidisciplinary teams. <eob>
of decisions going <eol> xx and down the organization, <eob> we # want team xx decide. <eob>
But to do so, we xxxx # all the skills <eob> and expertise # xxx # that decision <eol> in the <eob>
this # brings difficult trade-offs. <eob>
Can we physically xxxxxxxxx xxx people <eol> who are working # in different buildings, <eob> xxxxxxxxx # or even <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries today? <eob>
Or should we invest <eol> in better # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx xxx do we ensure consistency <eol> the way we do things <eob> xxxxxx these teams? <eob>
We still need xxxx kind <eol> of management matrix. <eob>
Now, all # these changes to structure <eob> and xxxxxxx and -- <eob> xxxx xxx not easy. <eob>
But in the # end, <eob> found that the xxxx <eol> difficult xxxxx to # xxxxxx <eob> is # our own <eob>
Let me # try illustrate. <eob>
If we want these teams # to be fast, <eol> flexible, creative, a mini-start-up, <eob> they have to xx # and <eob>
But means leaders <eol> commanding what to xxx <eob> when do, how xx do. <eob>
No xxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
also means that # each employee <eol> needs to become a xxxxxxx <eob> regardless # xx their formal title. <eob>
about all xx xxxxxxxx # up <eob> to take initiative. <eob>
Now xxxxxxxxxx # we cannot afford <eob> to # have these teams <eol> running # in different directions, <eob> because that would <eol> certainly # lead # to # xxxxxx <eob>
So xx need alignment <eob> and autonomy <eol> xx the same time, <eob> just a flock of birds. <eob>
In xx organizational # setting, <eob> requires xxx <eob> and with each # new behavior, <eob> there # is # giving up <eol> on something # old as xxxxx <eob>
Leaders have to make sure <eol> everyone the <eob> aligned around <eol> the overall xxxxxxx -- # <eol> # xxx -- <eob> and the overall # xxxxxxxxxx # xx the what. <eob>
But then they have # to # let go <eol> their xxxxx to make # the xxxxx decisions <eol> on how get there. <eob>
Now, # creating alignment requires <eol> open and xxxxxxxxxxx communication. <eob>
But xxx # xxx say <eol> that information is source # of power? <eob>
Well, for # # <eob> information may # xxxx as xx <eol> they're # # up xxxxxx xx power. <eob>
And it's not # just <eob>
The teams need to communicate <eol> openly xxx transparently as xxxxx <eob>
xx these companies, the # xxxxx <eol> typically in short xxxxxxxx <eob> and # at xxx end of xxxxxxx <eol> xxxx organize a # demo session <eob> the output <eol> of what # they've # done, transparently. <eob>
And every <eob> each member # of the team gives # an update <eob> of xxxx they <eol> are working xx individually. <eob>
all this # <eol> can # xxx <eob> because there is <eol> no place to hide anymore. <eob>
Everything we do <eol> is xxxxxxxxxxx for everyone. <eob>
xxx alignment # is xxx <eob> and providing autonomy <eol> is # xxx # so obvious, xxxxxxx <eob>
One at another # company <eob> likes to explain how # used to be x # master # of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxx know # how things going, <eob> instead of xx # <eob> status reports, <eob> xx <eob> needs to walk down to team floors <eol> to # attend xx their xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxxxxxx of telling people # what to do, <eob> xx # looks xxx ways xx help # them. <eob>
is radical # xxxxxx <eol> xxx someone who used to <eol> master # milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in old world, this # executive said, <eob> xx only had the of xxxxxxxx <eob>
In reality, # many xxxxxxxx would run <eol> over time xxx over anyway. <eob>
Now # x have # more xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> and # xxx course-correct <eol> xxxxxxx if xxxxxxxx <eob>
middle # managers <eol> need # to change as xxxxx <eob>
First of all, without the handovers <eol> and xxx PowerPoint, there's less of a need <eol> middle managers. <eol>
And in the old world, there was <eol> idea of thinkers xxx doers. <eob>
would just follow orders. <eob>
But now, xxxxxxx of only <eol> xxxxxxxx people, <eob> middle managers # were expected <eol> to become player-coaches. <eob>
So for xxx last 10 <eob> xxx # been # telling <eol> other xxxxxx # what xx # do, <eob> but xxx you're expected <eol> do things xxxxxxxx again. <eob>
Clearly, model is not for everyone, <eob> and some xxxxx people leave the <eob>
xxx the result # is x new # culture <eob> xxxx less # hierarchy. <eob>
xxx # all # xx this # xx xxxx work. <eob>
xxx it's worth it. <eob>
xxx xxxx I worked with, <eob> they were used to deploying <eol> new product features a few xxxxx xxx year. <eob>
Now they have # releases every few <eob> xxx without the handovers <eol> and red tape, <eob> xxx whole <eol> becomes more <eob>
And finally, if xxx # the halls <eol> of these companies today, <eob> you just feel a energy. <eob>
It feels as walking <eol> the halls of a very # large start-up. <eob>
Now, to be fair, # these xxxxxxxxxx <eol> they # xxxxxx claim victory yet. <eob>
But at # xxxxx with # this new <eob> they are much better # prepared <eol> xx respond to <eob>
The # world is # getting faster <eol> and xxxx # complex, <eob> xx we need xx xxx # way of working. <eob>
And # # hardest part of that change <eol> is not # in # structure <eob> xx xxxxxxx or procedure, <eob> and it's # xxxx not just <eol> senior executives # charge. <eob>

We're coming up on over # xxx employees, <eol> xxx they live everywhere, <eob> # California to # Alabama, xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> to where x live Texas. <eob>
They're also in 67 # countries. <eob>
xxxxxxx Mexico, India, New # xxxxxxxx <eob>
Some of them # choose # <eol> not xxxx <eol> to have a xxxx xxxxx they're xxxxxxx <eob>
they xxx RVs <eol> xx traveling xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx <eob> they are new places <eol> day, xxxx month. <eob>
xx # long they can find xxxx Wi-Fi, <eol> we don't # where they are. <eob>
focus # on distributed work <eol> xxxxxx accidentally. <eob>
It was a conscious <eol> from # the xxxx beginning. <eob>
Notice I don't <eob> xxx # the word "remote," <eob> xxxxxxx it sets up # expectation, <eob> that some people are essential <eol> xxx some aren't. <eob>
I use the word "distributed" <eol> xx we do, <eob> where # everyone is <eol> on an xxxxx playing field. <eob>
I think a distributed workforce <eob> the most effective way <eol> to # build a company. <eob>
The # key is you have <eol> xx # <eob>
When # we # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> many of the first 20 # hires <eol> were I'd # met in person.
But we'd collaborated online, <eol> sometimes xxx years. <eob>
I wanted xx continue that <eol> for one # simple reason. <eob>
I # believe that and intelligence <eob> distributed <eol> throughout the # world. <eob> is xxxx <eob>
In Silicon Valley, <eol> big tech companies # <eob> from essentially <eol> the # same xxxxx pond # or bay. <eob>
A company <eol> can # from the <eob> entire xxxxxx <eob>
Instead xx someone who <eol> grew xx <eol> in Japan but lives in California, <eob> you can gain someone who # lives, # <eob> wakes up and goes to # sleep <eol> xxxxxxxx they # are in # the world. <eob> They bring # different <eol> understanding of that culture <eob> xxx # a different lived experience. <eob>
At # the base of xxx decision <eol> to distributed, <eob> there's a desire to give people <eol> over # how <eol> # do their # work. <eob>
Unless xx a role <eol> where specific hours are important, <eob> you can make your own # schedule. <eob>
Everyone # can # have a corner office, <eol> their windows, food want xx eat, <eob> xxx can xxxx # there's music <eol> and when there's # silence. <eob>
You can choose # what temperature <eol> the room should be. <eob>
You can save # time <eol> you'd spend commuting <eob> and <eob> put xxxx # <eol> that are xxxxxxxxx # to you. <eob>
# workforce <eol> is xxxxx for a # <eob>
But people often xxx <eob> "This works # for y'all, <eol> but xxxx # about everyone else?" <eob> If you have an office, xxx can xx # few <eob> to xxxxx # distributed # capability. <eob>
First: document <eob>
In xxxxxxx # it's # <eol> xx xxxx xxxxxxxxx in the moment, <eob> in the kitchen, in the <eob>
xxx people work xxxxxxxx <eob> and xxxx members of the xxxx <eol> having those conversations <eob> they # don't have to, <eob> they'll # see decisions being # made <eol> without xxxxxxxxxxxxx the why. <eol>
Always leave xxxxx of where # xxx # were <eol> and what xxx # thinking about. <eob>
This xxxxxx others to # pick up <eol> where you left off. <eob>
It people in different <eol> time zones to interact, <eob> it's also great think xxxxx <eol> as organization <eob> people xxxxxxx and people xxxxxxxx <eob>
Try # have as much <eol> as possible online. <eob>
xxxx everything's shared # and public, it allows new # people xx catch up quickly. <eob>
xxx <eob> also xxxx to xxxx xxx right <eob>
There are so many apps services <eol> that help with xxxxxxxxxx communication, <eob> video conferencing, project management. <eob>
xxx things xxxx changed how # you work <eol> probably aren't xxxxxxx anymore. <eob>
They're things you access <eol> through your # <eob>
So experiment with different <eol> tools enable collaboration, <eol> xxx what works. <eol>
xxxxxx productive, face-to-face xxxxx <eob>
In a traditional office, you're # in the same place <eol> xx weeks xxx of the xxxx <eob> and # you might # xxxx <eol> three or four weeks apart. <eob>
We try # to flip that: # we # come together <eol> xxx short, intense bursts. <eob> Once a we do # a grand meet-up <eob> xxxxx the entire company <eol> comes for a <eob>
It's half-work, <eob>
primary xx people. <eob> xxxx to # make <eol> everyone's aligned and xxxx page, <eob> and they have a deeper # connection <eol> with colleagues. <eob>
xxxx they xxxx together <eol> the rest of the year, <eob> they can # together <eol> understanding and empathy. <eob>
And the final # practice: <eob> give people the flexibility <eol> to make their own work xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Every person at Automattic <eol> has # co-working stipend <eob> that # they can # put <eol> towards <eob> or to xxxxxxx they don't <eol> xxx kicked out of the coffee shop. <eob>
group # in Seattle <eol> xxxxxxx xx pool xxxxx stipends together <eob> and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. <eob>
Each person # who joins the company <eol> gets a home-office <eob>
# is money they xxx # invest <eob> xx # getting xxx right xxxxxx monitor, <eob> xxx right desk setup, so they have <eol> the xxxx environment for # them. <eob>
Today, # xxxx a few companies <eol> are distributed # first. <eob>
In decade or xxxx <eol> I predict that # 90 # percent # # companies <eob> that are going to be changing <eol> the # course # the world <eob> are going to function this <eob>
xxxx will evolve xx distributed first, <eol> or they'll be replaced by those that are. <eob>
As you about <eol> xxxx you're going to build <eob> consider how can xxx <eol> into global talent, <eob> give # # to xxxx # and # work where xxxx they <eob> and # participate fully whatever <eol> it is that you're creating together. <eob>
