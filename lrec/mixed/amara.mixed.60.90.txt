For our xxxxx <eob> goal, <eob> instead # xx starting <eob> tens <eob> and # thousands <eob> xx these very <eob> # expensive # medical like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, we started with a # xxxxxxx image. <eol>

Well, <eob> xxxx # <eob> one way xx what <eob> x to be the most change <eol> xxxx is needed in ways of working today. <eol>
The world is <eob> getting faster <eol> xxx complex, so xx xxxx a new # way # <eol> xx working, way that creates alignment around # purpose, xxxx xxxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> and that xxxxx empowers xx # decisions <eob>
But xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> order to get there, what are # we willing xx # give # up? <eob>
A few ago, x was with x xxxx <eol> wanted to <eob> on x # <eob>
They <eob> wanted <eob> their to simpler, <eob> more more # relevant.
Now, xxx not xxx # <eob> many of <eob> # you <eob> have seen x from the # xxxxxxx <eob> so xx try # to illustrate what many traditional # banks xxxx like.
xxx see # lots xx # people suits taking elevators to # go <eol> to # department, <eob> xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eob> engineers with etc. <eol>
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people where gets xxxxxxxx
ideas? They end <eob> # <eob> up <eob> xx PowerPoint parking lots. <eob>
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can <eob> take xxxxxxxx
So this bank knew xxxx in # # transform, xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx <eob> their time xx # market drastically changing their # <eob> # of # # xx well. <eol>
But how? <eob>
xx # get some xxxxxxx <eol> xx # xx <eob> and # # a <eob> look # xxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx to xx more # innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
xxx I remember how # we # <eob> the <eol> # halls at # these companies xx # December 2014, a management # consultant and x # team of bankers. <eob>
xxxx <eob> # strangers # a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eol>
So xxxx we <eob> # asked, "How xx <eol> your company organized?" <eob> And xx expected xx xxx xx org <eob>
xxx <eob> instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx drawings <eob> xxxx # funny xxxxx <eol> like # xxxxxxxx and "chapters" # "tribes" xx explain how were organized.
So then # we tried translate <eol> xxxx our # own world. <eol>
We asked, "How <eob> many xxxxxx <eol> are <eob> xxxxxxx # you?" <eol> # depends". <eol>
# do # <eob> report <eob> <eob>
"Who xxxxxxx on <eob> # priorities?" <eol> "It
You <eol> xxx # imagine # our <eol>
We # were # asking xxx some # the basic # xxxxxxxxxx <eol> of <eob> organizations, <eol> and answer xxxx xxx depends".
Now, course # of that xxxx <eol> gained # a # better xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their <eob>
They in xxx power <eol> xxxxxx autonomous teams. <eob>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups.
had # # people <eol> and # engineers # <eob> in the same team so they could <eob> # design, # build <eob> and test ideas # <eol> customers <eob> independently <eob> of others xx <eol> the company.
xxxx # did xxxx # <eob> handovers <eol> #
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed right there in the team. <eob>
Now, # at the of that <eob> x # session # reflect xx <eob> what xx had # learned.
# we xxx # started to # their # model, so xx were thinking of how xxxxx some of # these ideas xx a # xxxxx <eob>
But then, one # of hosts, <eob> a <eol> who said <eob> # a # all day, <eob> xx suddenly <eob> said, <eol> xxx you <eol> xxx xxxxxx <eob>
But x have <eol> one question you: <eol> What xxx willing # to # xxxx up?" <eob> xxxx xx xxxxxxx to # give up? <eol>
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, <eol> but # we xxxx he was right. <eob>
# xx not # only <eob> embracing the <eob> it's about up <eol> some of # xxx <eob> old as <eol> well. <eob>
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx <eol> # <eob> have # with companies <eol> xxxx xxx # xxxxx to # xxxxxx ways of # working.
xxxxxxxx # every <eol> company <eol> has their xxx skeptics <eol> about why # this # is not going <eob> # xx work <eol> # for # <eol>
xxxx # product is # more complex," <eol> or "They don't xxxx the legacy # IT like do," "Regulators <eol> # just won't allow this <eol> xx # our industry".
But for this # also <eob> xxx <eol> # companies <eob> that x xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> was possible. <eob>
x # we completely <eol> xxxx # up old <eob> silos <eol> xxxxxxx <eob> xxxxxxxx channels <eob> # and IT. <eob>
Three thousand employees <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx
So instead of product xxxxxx <eob> sitting xxxx xxxx product people <eob> and engineers # with engineers, a product person # xx engineer were members of # same xxxxx <eol>
xxx <eob> xxxxx # xx <eob> # member of # a team <eob> responsible account # opening <eol> or for the # mobile banking xxxx etc. <eob>
At xxxxxxx date <eol> that # new xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx # <eob> people were shaking # xxxxx for # xxx very first only # # find # <eol> out that they had been <eob> sitting two minutes away # xxxx # each # but they were sending each # other emails <eob> xxx status # xxx the # <eol> last # 10 # years.
# would xxxx <eol> someone saying, <eob> # xx you're the guy that was <eob> for answers". <eob> (Laughter)
now, # they're # xxxxxx <eol> together # <eol> every
If the product # # an # <eol> xxxxx <eol> he # xxxx <eol> xxxxx it <eob> to # get input from # the engineer who # xxxxxxx xxxx
can decide to # test <eob> with xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> -- <eol> no # xx PowerPoints, no red tape, just # getting xxxxx done. <eob>
# getting <eob> # <eob> is xxx easy. <eol>
And as it turns out, "What # you # willing # to # xxxx # <eob> up?" is exactly the right question to ask. <eol>
Autonomous # requires # <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions going up and down the organization, we want # xxxx # # decide. <eob>
But # to xx so, xxxx all the skills xxx expertise # for that decision <eob> in <eob>
# this <eob> brings trade-offs. <eob>
# we <eob> physically xxx xxxxxx <eob> who are in different buildings, xxxxxxxxx cities xx even <eol> xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eob>
Or # xx <eob> in # better videoconferencing? <eol>
xxx do we <eol> # xxxxxx <eob> in # the way we do xxxxxx <eol> these teams? <eob>
We xxxxx xxxx # <eob> of xxxxxxxxxx matrix.
# xxx # these xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx and process # and xx they # not xxxxx <eob>
But the xxxx I xxxxx # that # # most difficult # xx # change <eob> is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eol>
xxx me try
xxxx # these teams # <eob> be fast, <eol> flexible, # <eol> # x # they xxxx to # be <eob> empowered xxx autonomous. <eol>
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx leaders <eol> commanding # their # people what to <eob> # xxx <eob> when to do, how <eob> # xx
No # <eob> micromanagers. <eob>
But it means that each employee xxxxx # <eob> xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxx # formal <eob> xxxxxx
xxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx # xx xx xxxx initiative.
# xxxxxxxxxx xx # xxxx cannot afford <eob> xxxx all # these teams <eob> in <eob> xxxxxxxxx <eob> directions, xxxxxxx xxxx would certainly # <eol> lead to chaos. <eol>
we # and xxxxxxxx <eol> at # same xxxxx just # xxxx flock # of birds. <eol>
an organizational # setting, <eol> requires new behaviors, <eob> xxx with xxxx behavior, <eob> there is up <eol> on # old <eob> well. <eob>
Leaders # xxxx to make sure <eol> xxxx everyone in the organization <eol> is xxxxxxx # around the <eob> purpose xx the # why -- <eob> the overall # priorities -- xxx # xxxxx <eob>
then # have to let # go <eol> and # <eob> xxxx the right decisions <eol> # how # to get there. <eob>
Now, creating xxxxxxxxx requires <eol> open # <eol> xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication. <eob>
But you know # how they # <eol> xxx that # information # source # of power?
xxxxx for some # managers, xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if # giving # up that xxxxxx of # power. <eob>
And it's <eol> just # xxxxxxxxx <eob>
teams <eol> xxxxxx and # xx <eol> # well.
xx xxx # teams <eob> typically # xxxx xxxxx <eol> and xx # end of # every sprint, <eol> they organize # a xxxx # to share the of what done, # transparently. <eol>
And # day, <eob> each <eob> # member of # # xxxx gives an of they are xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable # for # people, because # suddenly, there xx xxxxx to hide # anymore. <eob>
Everything we <eol> xxx everyone. <eol>
So, is xxx # <eob> and # is not # # either.
One # executive # likes # xx how xx xxxx to be <eol> a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>
Now, today, to # xxxx how # are <eol> # <eob> going, instead # <eob> of xxxxxxx <eob> at status # reports, <eol> he # needs to walk # # # # xxxx floors <eol> one of # their sessions.
instead of # people xxxx to do, <eol> he looks # ways to <eob> # help # them.
xxxx is <eob> change for # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eob> # xxxxxx <eob> of milestone-tracking.
But in # the old world, xxxx executive xxxxx <eol> "I only the xxxxxxxx control.
In reality, projects would # run <eob> over time over anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, <eob> and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx earlier xxxxxxxx <eol>
And middle xxxxxxxx <eob> need to change as well. <eob>
First <eob> of all, without the PowerPoint, there's # less # of # a need <eob> for middle managers.
And # in <eob> xxx <eob> # there was # idea of and doers. <eob>
# would <eob> # xxxx follow orders. <eob>
But # <eol> # instead of xxxx <eol> other <eob> middle managers # expected <eob> to become # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xx # xxx the last xx you xxxx been # telling <eol> other xxxxxx # what xx <eob> but <eol> xxxxxx expected <eol> # xx things yourself
xxxxxxxx # this model # <eob> is xxx xxx everyone, xxx # xxxx great # people leave # the <eol>
xxx xxx result # a # culture xxxx less # <eol>
xxx <eob> of xxxx # xxxx work.
But # it. <eob>
The companies that # <eol> x worked with, <eob> they <eob> # were <eob> used # xxxxxxxxx <eol> xxx features # few # times # year. <eob>
Now xxxx # every few weeks, <eob> and # xxx handovers <eol> # # red <eol> tape, <eol> # whole # xxxxxxxxxxxx more xxxxxxxxxx
xxx # finally, xxxx # <eob> these # companies xxxxxx just a # new <eob>
