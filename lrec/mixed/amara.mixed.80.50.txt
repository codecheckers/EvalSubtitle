xxx xx # <eob> by # using # what <eol> xxxxx # our # system, <eob> I was # able # # identify # xxxxxxx <eol> # fight # to # build xxxx <eol> our cuts # bruises. <eob>
When looking at xxxxxxxxx <eol> # are # <eob> xxxxx # tested <eob> xxxxx abilities # to help # xxxxxx # xxxxxxx our xxxx # that after xxxxxxxx <eol> an # xxxxxxx muscle # xxxx these # materials, <eob> xxxxx # # <eob> x xxxxx # number # xxxxxx cells <eob> xx xxxxxxxx <eob> # surrounding <eol>

# specific <eob> xxxx of # xxxxxx xxxxx xxx # # cell, <eob> was present # inside <eol> xxxx material # # xxxxxxxxxx critical healing. <eob>
Now, # like xxxx a <eol> xxx you'd # xxxxx xxxx xxxxxx <eob> and try and back # together # <eob> xx can # <eob> xxx it xxxxx not xx # most xxxxxxxxxx and we'll get a <eob>
xx if xxxxx # xxxx # helper # x xxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx healthy <eob> our muscle develops <eol> fat cells xxxxxx # <eob> xxx <eob> and fat in our muscle, <eol> isn't xx strong. <eob>
Now, xxxxx xxx # <eol> immune system, <eob> xxx # xxxxx xxxx # back <eob> these # scars <eob> xxxx like what # xxx before <eob> we # were xxxx <eob>

We # any # time x material xx # implanted # body, <eob> the # immune xxxxxx xxxx respond # it. <eob>
This from pacemakers xx # pumps <eob> # that # engineers # xxx using <eol> xx # xxx # new xxxxxxx <eob>
when # that # material, <eol> or # scaffold, in the xxxxx <eol> the # system # <eob> a <eob> xxxxx environment # cells and xxxxxxxx xxxx can way <eob> that xxx # stem xxxxx xxxxxxx
Now, just # like xxx # xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxx # daily # xxxx xxxxx for a xxx <eob> or xxxxxxx xxx binge-watching <eol> an entire # Netflix, <eob> the xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx of scaffold <eob> # <eol> xxx that <eol> # xxxx # cells # and xxxxxxxx <eob>
