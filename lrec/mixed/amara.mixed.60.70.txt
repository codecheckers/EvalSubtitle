Our second goal <eob> -- # xx were <eob> more <eob> xx # wanted to # the use <eol> of medical xxxxxxx technologies <eob> to xxxxxx
how did # we xx it?
For our xxxxx goal, <eob> instead # xx starting <eol> tens <eol> and # thousands <eob> xx <eol> these very # expensive # medical like xxxxxxxxxxx AI, <eob> we started with a # xxxxxxx image.

xx # a xxxxxx we converted xxx # xxxxx into xxxxxxxx # of <eol> # xxxxxxxx # <eob> data massively # the amount of <eob> xxxx xxxxxx # for # training. <eob>
For our xxxxxx # xxxxx <eol> xx xxxxxx the # use # expensive medical <eol> technologies to screen patients, <eob> # with a xxxxxxxxx <eol> white light photograph, <eob> acquired xxxxxx xxxx camera or a # mobile # xxx xxx # xxxxxxxx <eol>
remember those <eol> billions # # information # <eob> packets? <eol>

Much # to our <eol> xx only required xx <eol> -- <eob> repeat, <eol> xxxx 50 <eob> -- <eob> of # these xxxxxx to # our xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eol>

More # importantly, xxx # can # accept, in # the future # and even right xxxx some # xxxx xxxxxxx # white # <eol> photographs from xxx # patient, <eob> instead xx expensive <eol> medical # imaging technologies. <eob>

using our immune <eob> system, <eob> our <eob> body xxxxx xxxx back <eol> without # these # scars <eob> and # look # like # what it was <eol> before xx xxxx xxxxxxxx
I'm working to xxxxxx # <eob> # give us the <eob> # xxxxx new <eob> by # the immune response. <eob>
We # know that xxx # xxxx <eol> a material is in our body, <eol> immune respond it. <eob>
This from # pacemakers <eol> to insulin xxxxx <eob> to the # materials that # engineers xxxxx to try # and build new tissue. <eob>
xx when I place xxxxxxxxx <eob> or scaffold, # in the body, <eob> the # xxxxxx # # xxxxxxx a small environment of cells # and proteins <eol> can # change the # way <eol> that our # stem # cells behave. <eob>

xxx researchers <eob> can xxxx make the materials <eol> xxxxxxx different xxxxxxx # <eol> over time.
So # other words, we # xxxxxxxxxxx this Broadway # show of cells <eob> xxxxxx xxxx the xxxxxxx <eol> cues and props <eob> xxxx can be # changed # different # <eob> tissues, <eob> like a xxxxxxxx # would # <eol> xxxx # versus <eol> "Little Shop # <eob>

Now, xxxx # does # have # xx <eol> xx with any one xx # us?
Well, xxxx # one way xx what <eol> x to be the most change <eob> xxxx is needed in ways of working today. <eob>
The world is getting faster xxx complex, <eob> so xx xxxx a new # way # xx working, <eob> way that <eol> creates <eol> alignment around # purpose, xxxx xxxxx xxx # xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> and that xxxxx empowers <eol> xx <eob> # decisions <eol>
But xxx xxxxxxxx <eob> order to get there, what are # we willing xx # give # up?
A few ago, x was with x <eob> xxxx wanted to on x # <eob>
They wanted their to simpler, <eol> more more # relevant. <eob>
Now, xxx not xxx # many of # you <eob> have seen x from the # xxxxxxx <eol> so xx try # to illustrate <eol> what many traditional # banks xxxx like. <eob>
xxx see <eol> # lots xx # people suits <eob> taking elevators to # go <eol> to # department, xxxxxxxxx sitting with marketers, <eol> engineers with etc. <eob>
You # see xxxxxxxx with 20 people <eob> where gets xxxxxxxx <eol>
ideas? They end <eol> # up <eol> xx PowerPoint parking lots. <eol>
And xxxxx xxx endless handovers <eol> xxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Getting anything done can take xxxxxxxx <eob>
So this bank knew <eol> xxxx in # # <eob> transform, <eob> xxxx would have to # xxxxxxx their time xx # market <eob> drastically changing <eob> their # # of # # xx well. <eob>
But how? <eob>
xx # get some xxxxxxx <eol> xx # xx and # # a look # xxxxxxxxx xxxx to xx more # innovative, <eob> like Google, Netflix, # Spotify, Zappos. <eob>
xxx I remember how # we # <eob> the # <eol> halls at # these companies <eob> xx # December 2014, <eob> a management # consultant and x # team of bankers.
xxxx # strangers # a strange # land, <eol> surrounded # <eol> xxx xxxx of smart, creative employees. <eob>
So xxxx we # asked, <eol> "How xx your company organized?" <eol> And xx expected xx xxx xx org
xxx instead, xxxx used xxxxxxx drawings <eob> xxxx # funny xxxxx like # xxxxxxxx and "chapters" # "tribes" <eob> xx explain how were organized. <eob>
So then # we tried <eob> translate <eol> xxxx our # own world. <eob>
We <eob> asked, "How many xxxxxx <eol> are xxxxxxx # you?" <eob> # depends". <eob>
# do # report <eol> <eol>
"Who xxxxxxx on # priorities?" <eob> "It <eob>
You xxx # imagine # <eol> our <eob>
We # were # asking xxx <eob> some # the basic # xxxxxxxxxx <eob> of organizations, <eob> and answer xxxx xxx depends". <eob>
Now, course # of that xxxx <eol> gained # a # better <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxx of their
They in xxx power <eob> xxxxxx autonomous <eol> teams. <eob>
Their xxxx like mini-start-ups.
had # # people <eob> and # engineers # in the same <eob> team <eol> so they could <eol> # design, <eob> # build <eol> and test ideas # customers <eol> independently of others xx the company. <eob>
xxxx # did xxxx # handovers <eob> #
They xxx all the xxxxxx needed right there in the team. <eob>
Now, # at the of that <eol> x # session <eob> # reflect xx what xx had # learned. <eol>
# we xxx # started <eob> to # their # model, <eol> so xx <eob> were thinking of <eob> how <eob> xxxxx some of # these ideas xx <eol> a # xxxxx <eob>
But then, one # of hosts, <eol> a who said # a <eob> # all day, xx suddenly said, <eob> xxx you xxx xxxxxx <eol>
But x have one question you: What xxx willing # to # xxxx up?" xxxx xx xxxxxxx to # give up?
xx did not xxxx an xxxxxx immediately, <eob> but # we xxxx he was right. <eob>
# xx not # only embracing the <eob> it's about up <eol> some of # xxx old as well. <eob>
Now, over the # xxxx five xxxxxx # <eob> have # with companies <eol> xxxx xxx # xxxxx <eob> to # xxxxxx ways of # working.
xxxxxxxx # every company <eol> has their xxx skeptics <eob> about why # this # is not <eol> going # xx work # for # <eob>
xxxx # product <eob> is # more complex," <eol> or "They don't xxxx <eol> the legacy # IT like do," "Regulators # just won't <eob> allow this <eol> xx # our industry". <eob>
But for this # also <eol> xxx # companies <eob> that x xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eol> was possible.
x # we completely <eol> xxxx # up old silos <eol> xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx channels <eob> # and IT.
Three thousand employees <eob> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx
So instead of <eob> product xxxxxx <eol> sitting <eob> xxxx xxxx product people <eob> and engineers # with engineers, <eob> a <eob> product person # xx engineer <eob> were members of <eol> # same xxxxx <eol>
xxx xxxxx # xx # member <eol> of # a team <eob> responsible account # opening or for the # <eol> mobile banking xxxx etc. <eob>
At xxxxxxx date <eol> that # new xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob> xxxx # people were shaking # xxxxx for # xxx very first <eob> only # # find # out that they had been <eol> sitting two minutes away # xxxx # each # but they were sending each # other emails <eol> xxx status # xxx the # last # 10 # years.
# would xxxx someone saying, <eol> # xx you're the guy that <eol> was for answers". (Laughter) <eob>
now, # they're # xxxxxx together # every <eol>
If the product # # an # xxxxx he # xxxx xxxxx it <eol> to # <eob> get input from # the engineer <eol> who # xxxxxxx xxxx <eob>
can decide to # test <eol> with xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx <eob> -- no # xx PowerPoints, no red <eob> tape, <eob> just <eob> # getting xxxxx <eol> done. <eol>
# getting # is xxx easy.
And as it turns out, "What # you # willing # to # xxxx # up?" is exactly the right question to ask.
Autonomous # <eol> requires # xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
# of decisions going <eob> up and down the organization, <eol> we want # xxxx # # decide. <eol>
But # to xx so, xxxx all the skills <eol> xxx expertise # for that decision in
# <eol> this brings trade-offs. <eol>
# <eob> we physically xxx xxxxxx <eol> who are in different buildings, xxxxxxxxx cities xx <eob> even <eob> xxxxxxxxx countries # today? <eob>
Or # xx <eol> in # better videoconferencing? <eob>
xxx do we # xxxxxx <eol> in # the way we do xxxxxx <eol> these teams? <eob>
We xxxxx xxxx <eob> # <eol> of <eob> xxxxxxxxxx matrix. <eob>
# xxx # these xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx and process # and xx <eob> they # not xxxxx <eob>
But the xxxx <eob> I xxxxx # that # # most difficult # xx # change <eob> is # # own xxxxxxxxx <eob>
xxx me try <eob>
xxxx # these teams <eol> # be fast, <eob> flexible, # <eob> # x # <eol> they xxxx to # be empowered xxx autonomous.
But this xxxxx xx xxxxxx <eob> leaders <eol> commanding # their # people what <eol> to # xxx <eob> when to do, <eol> how # xx <eol>
No # micromanagers. <eol>
But it means that each employee <eol> xxxxx # xx # xxxxxx a xxxxxxx <eol> xxxxxxxxxx # formal xxxxxx <eol>
xxxx <eob> xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxx # xx <eol> xx xxxx initiative. <eob>
# <eob> xxxxxxxxxx xx # xxxx cannot afford <eob> xxxx all # these teams <eol> in xxxxxxxxx directions, xxxxxxx xxxx would <eob> certainly <eol> # lead to <eob> chaos. <eob>
we # and xxxxxxxx <eol> at # same xxxxx <eob> just # xxxx flock # of birds. <eol>
an organizational <eob> # <eob> setting, requires new behaviors, <eol> xxx <eob> with xxxx behavior, <eol> there is up <eob> on # old well.
Leaders # xxxx <eob> to make sure <eol> xxxx everyone in the organization <eol> is xxxxxxx # around the purpose xx the # why -- <eob> the overall # priorities -- xxx <eol> # xxxxx
then # have to let # go <eol> and # xxxx the right decisions # how # <eob> to get there. <eob>
Now, creating xxxxxxxxx requires <eol> open # xxx xxxxxxxxxxx # communication. <eob>
But you know # how they # xxx <eob> that # information # source # of power?
xxxxx for some # managers, xxxxxxx information # xxx as # if <eol> # giving # up that xxxxxx of # power. <eol>
And it's just # xxxxxxxxx <eol>
teams <eol> xxxxxx and # xx # well.
xx xxx # teams <eob> typically # xxxx xxxxx <eob> and xx # end of # every sprint, <eob> they organize # a xxxx # <eol> to share the <eol> of <eol> what done, # transparently. <eob>
And # day, <eob> each # member of # # xxxx gives an <eob> of they <eob> are xx xxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, all this transparency <eob> can be uncomfortable # for # people, <eob> because # suddenly, there <eol> xx xxxxx to hide # anymore. <eol>
Everything we xxx everyone.
So, is xxx # and # <eob> is not # # either. <eob>
One # executive # <eob> likes # xx how xx xxxx to be a xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <eob>
Now, today, to # xxxx how # are # going, <eol> instead # of xxxxxxx at status # reports, he # needs to walk # # # # xxxx floors <eob> one of # their sessions. <eob>
instead of # people xxxx to do, <eob> he looks # ways to # help # them. <eol>
xxxx is change <eob> for # xxxxxxx who # used to # be <eol> # xxxxxx of milestone-tracking. <eob>
But in # the old world, <eob> xxxx executive xxxxx <eol> "I only the xxxxxxxx control. <eob>
In reality, projects would # run <eob> over time over anyway. <eob>
Now I have much more transparency, <eob> and # I xxx # xxxxxxxxxxxxxx earlier xxxxxxxx <eol>
And middle xxxxxxxx <eol> need to change as well.
First of all, without <eol> the PowerPoint, <eob> there's # <eol> less # of # a need <eob> for middle managers. <eob>
And # in xxx <eol> # there was # idea of and doers. <eob>

Now xxxx # <eol> every few weeks, <eob> and # xxx handovers <eol> # # red tape, <eob> # whole # xxxxxxxxxxxx <eol> more xxxxxxxxxx <eob>
